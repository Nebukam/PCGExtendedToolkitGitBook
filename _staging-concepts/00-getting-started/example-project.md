# Example Project

The example project is the best way to see PCGEx in action across all major systems. It's divided into two parts:

- **Showroom** — Abstract showcases of individual nodes and features, one at a time
- **Examples** — More involved setups showing how nodes work together for complex results

## Getting the Project

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Download the project files

<a href="https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExExampleProject/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="button primary">Download the ZIP</a> or go to the <a href="https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExExampleProject" class="button primary">GitHub repo</a>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Install PCGEx

The project has PCGEx enabled in its settings but **does not include the plugin source**. Make sure you have PCGEx installed separately — see [Installation](installation.md) if you haven't already.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Open the project and explore

That's it. Browse the levels and inspect the PCG graphs to see how things are built.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The example project includes utility subgraphs that handle boilerplate (consistent formatting, shared setup). These are **not part of the plugin** — they're project-level helpers.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The example project is only maintained for the latest engine version. Older versions are preserved in git branches but may not reflect the full breadth of current features.
{% endhint %}
