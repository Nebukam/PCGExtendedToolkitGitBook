# Intersections

**Settings that define how geometric overlaps are detected and resolved.** Point-to-point fusing, point-to-edge snapping, edge-to-edge crossings, and path-to-edge cuts each have their own tolerance, filtering, and metadata options. These blocks appear on any node that needs to find or act on spatial intersections — cluster fusing, path crossings, and similar operations.
