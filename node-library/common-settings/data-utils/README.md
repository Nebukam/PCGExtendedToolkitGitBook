# Data Utils

**Settings that control how attributes and tags move between datasets.** Forwarding, carry-over, name filtering, and attribute-to-tag conversion all live here. Most nodes that produce or transform data expose one or more of these blocks, so the details are documented once and referenced everywhere else.
