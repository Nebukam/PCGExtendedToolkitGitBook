# Forward Details

Configures how attributes are forwarded from source data to target points during operations.

### Overview

This settings block controls attribute forwarding — the process of copying attribute values from one data set to another. When operations like sampling, copying, or pathfinding need to transfer metadata from source points to results, these settings determine which attributes are forwarded and how missing values are handled.

### How It Works

1. **Enable Forwarding**: Toggle whether forwarding occurs at all
2. **Filter Attributes**: Use name patterns to include or exclude specific attributes
3. **Transfer Values**: Matching attributes are copied from source to target points

### Behavior

```
Source Points:          Target Points (after forwarding):

[A] Color=Red           [X] ← receives Color=Red
[B] Color=Blue          [Y] ← receives Color=Blue
[C] Color=Green         [Z] ← receives Color=Green

With Forwarding Disabled:
[X] [Y] [Z] ← no attributes transferred
```

### Settings

<summary><strong>Preserve Attributes Default Value</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, attributes that don't have a matching source value retain their default values rather than being left uninitialized.

Default: `false`
