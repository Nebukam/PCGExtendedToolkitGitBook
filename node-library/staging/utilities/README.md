# Utilities

**Supporting nodes for the staging pipeline.** Staging Data Mesh Selector picks meshes from staged data for downstream use, Sample Sockets reads socket transforms from placed assets, Asset Collection to Set converts collections into vanilla PCG attribute sets, and Collection to Module Infos bridges staging data into the valency system. These handle the plumbing between staging and other PCGEx systems.
