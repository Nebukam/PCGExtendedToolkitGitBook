# Collections

**Asset collections are the input side of staging — weighted sets of meshes, actors, or PCG data assets that distribution and fitting nodes draw from.** Each collection type wraps a different asset class but exposes the same interface to downstream consumers. Pick the collection type that matches what you're placing.

For the concepts behind collections and how they feed into the staging pipeline, see [Collections](../../../working-with-pcgex/asset-staging/collections.md).
