# Level Data Exporter

Abstract base class for level-to-PCGDataAsset conversion.

### Overview

Level Data Exporter defines the interface for converting a loaded UWorld into a `UPCGDataAsset`. It is instanced directly on Level Collection entries via Unreal's `EditInlineNew` pattern, so subclasses can expose custom properties in the collection's details panel. The base class itself has no settings — all behavior comes from subclasses.

### How It Works

1. **Instancing**: A Level Collection entry references a Level Data Exporter instance. The exporter is created inline and configured per-entry.
2. **Export Call**: When staging data is rebuilt, the collection calls `ExportLevelData` with the loaded world and a target `UPCGDataAsset`. The asset's `TaggedData` is cleared before the call.
3. **Custom Logic**: Subclasses populate the data asset with point data, metadata, and optionally embedded collections.

**Usage Notes**

* **Abstract**: This class cannot be used directly. Use the built-in Default Level Data Exporter, or subclass in C++ or Blueprint.
* **Blueprintable**: The `ExportLevelData` function is a `BlueprintNativeEvent`, so Blueprint subclasses can override the export logic without C++.
* **Inline Editing**: Because the class uses `EditInlineNew` and `DefaultToInstanced`, derived exporters appear as editable sub-objects directly inside the Level Collection entry's details panel.

### Settings

No settings. This is an abstract base class. See subclass documentation for configuration.

#### Subclasses

* **Default Level Data Exporter** — Classifies actors as Mesh or Actor, creates typed point data, and optionally generates embedded collections.
