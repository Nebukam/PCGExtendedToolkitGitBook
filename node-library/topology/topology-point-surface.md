# Topology : Point Surface

Create a Delaunay triangulated surface for each input dataset.

### Overview

This node generates a triangulated mesh surface directly from point data using Delaunay triangulation. Unlike cluster-based topology nodes, it doesn't require edge connectivity - it computes the optimal triangulation from point positions alone.

### How It Works

1. **Project to 2D**: Points are projected onto a 2D plane using the specified projection method.
2. **Delaunay Triangulation**: The algorithm computes a Delaunay triangulation, which maximizes the minimum angle of all triangles for optimal mesh quality.
3. **Build Mesh**: Triangles are assembled into a PCG Dynamic Mesh with the original 3D positions preserved.
4. **Apply Settings**: Material, UV mapping, normals, and other topology settings are applied to the output mesh.

## Performance Consideration

This node uses Unreal's built-in Geometry Script Delaunay algorithm, which is significantly slower than the Delaunator library used by other PCGEx nodes (such as Delaunay 2D). If you only need the triangulation topology and not a Dynamic Mesh output, consider using those alternatives for better performance.

**Usage Notes**

* **Point-Based**: This node works directly on point data without requiring cluster/edge information. Every point becomes a vertex in the output mesh.
* **Convex Hull**: The triangulation covers the convex hull of the projected points. Points on the interior create additional triangles.
* **Minimum Points**: Requires at least 3 non-collinear points to produce a valid triangulation.

### Behavior

```
Input: Scattered points         Output: Triangulated mesh

      ●           ●                   ●───────────●
            ●                              /\  /\
                          →              /  \/  \
    ●       ●       ●               ●───●────●───●
          ●                               \ /\ /
      ●       ●                       ●───●──●

All points become vertices connected by Delaunay triangles.

### Settings

#### Node-Specific Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Projection Details</strong> <code>FPCGExGeo2DProjectionDetails</code></summary>

Settings for projecting 3D points onto a 2D plane for triangulation. The triangulation is computed in 2D, but the resulting mesh uses the original 3D point positions.

//→ See TODO FPCGExGeo2DProjectionDetails

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Attempt Repair</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Attempt to repair degenerate geometry (zero-area triangles, duplicate vertices) after triangulation.

Default: `false`

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Repair Degenerate</strong> <code>FGeometryScriptDegenerateTriangleOptions</code></summary>

Options for handling degenerate triangles during repair.
