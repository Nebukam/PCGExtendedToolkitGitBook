# Topology : Cluster Surface

Create a cluster surface topology.

### Overview

This node converts point clusters with edge connections into triangulated surface meshes. Each cluster's cells (the polygons formed by connected edges) are identified, filtered by constraints, and triangulated into a PCG Dynamic Mesh output.

### How It Works

1. **Identify Cells**: The node traces the cluster's edge connectivity to identify closed cells (polygons formed by the graph structure).
2. **Project to 2D**: Points are projected onto a 2D plane for triangulation using the specified projection method.
3. **Apply Constraints**: Cells are filtered based on size, point count, area, perimeter, compactness, and other geometric properties.
4. **Triangulate**: Valid cells are triangulated to create mesh faces.
5. **Build Mesh**: All triangles are combined into a single PCG Dynamic Mesh with optional UV mapping, normals, and material assignment.

**Usage Notes**

* **Cluster Input**: This node expects cluster data (vertices + edges) as input. Use cluster-building nodes upstream to create the graph structure.
* **Cell Detection**: A "cell" is any closed polygon formed by following edges around the cluster. The algorithm finds all minimal cycles in the graph.
* **Edge Constraints**: You can optionally filter which edges participate in cell formation using the edge constraints input pin.

### Behavior

```
Input: Point cluster          Output: Triangulated mesh
with edges
    ●───●───●                     ●───●───●
    │ ╲ │ ╱ │                     │\  │  /│
    │  ╲│╱  │         →           │ \ │ / │
    ●───●───●                     ●──\●/──●
    │ ╱ │ ╲ │                     │  /│\  │
    ●───●───●                     ●───●───●

Each enclosed region becomes a triangulated face in the output mesh.
