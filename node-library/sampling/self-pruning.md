# Self Pruning

A slower, more precise self pruning node.

### Overview

This node removes overlapping points within a single point collection based on their bounds. It offers more precision than simpler pruning methods by using oriented bounding box testing and configurable expansion values. Points can be sorted to control which overlapping points are kept, or the node can output overlap counts instead of pruning.

### How It Works

1. **Build Bounds**: Creates bounds for each point with optional expansion.
2. **Sort Points**: Orders points by configurable criteria for priority.
3. **Test Overlaps**: Detects bounds intersections using precise or fast tests.
4. **Prune or Write**: Either removes overlapping points or writes overlap counts.

**Usage Notes**

* **Prune Mode**: Removes overlapping points based on sort priority.
* **Write Result Mode**: Outputs overlap count instead of removing points.
* **Precise Test**: Uses oriented bounding boxes for more accurate overlap detection.
* **Expansion**: Grow bounds before or after transform to adjust overlap sensitivity.

### Behavior

**Self Pruning:**

```
Points with overlapping bounds:
   P0: bounds overlap P1, P2
   P1: bounds overlap P0
   P2: bounds overlap P0

Sort Direction = Ascending (lower index wins):
   → P0 kept (highest priority)
   → P1 pruned (overlaps P0)
   → P2 pruned (overlaps P0)

Write Result Mode:
   → P0.NumOverlaps = 2
   → P1.NumOverlaps = 1
   → P2.NumOverlaps = 1
```

#### Expansion

**This doesn't modify your points**

The expansion settings here are **only for overlap testing** — they don't actually change your point bounds. The node tests overlaps "as if" the bounds were expanded, then prunes based on those tests. Your output points keep their original `$BoundsMin`/`$BoundsMax` values.

If you need to actually modify point bounds, use a **Bounds Modifier** node before or after.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Why "Before/After Transform"?

Point bounds (`$BoundsMin`/`$BoundsMax`) are stored in **local space** — they don't include the point's scale, rotation, or position. To test overlaps in world space, the node must apply the point's transform.

The question is: do you want to expand **before** or **after** that transform is applied?

**Before Transform** — Works like PCG's Bounds Modifier. Expansion happens in local space, then gets scaled/rotated with the point.

* Expand by 10 on a point with scale 10 → effective expansion of 100 in world space
* Good when you want expansion proportional to point size

**After Transform** — Expansion happens in world space after all transforms.

* Expand by 10 → always exactly 10 units in world space, regardless of point scale
* Good when you want consistent spacing in world units

**Quick rule**: If you want behavior like Bounds Modifier, use **Before Transform**. If you want exact world-space distances, use **After Transform**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
## Primary vs Secondary Bounds

Overlap testing checks each point against all others. These settings let you expand bounds differently for each role:

* **Primary bounds**: The point currently being evaluated ("Am I overlapping anything?")
* **Secondary bounds**: All other points being tested against ("What am I checking against?")

Usually you only need to expand one or the other. Expanding primary makes each point "claim more space." Expanding secondary makes neighbors appear larger.
