# Sample : Nearest Path

Sample the nearest path(s).

### Overview

With default settings, this is a **containment sampler** — it answers "which paths contain this point?" rather than "which paths are nearby?" Each source point is tested against paths using 2D projection, and only paths whose closed boundary encloses the point are sampled. Range limits are bypassed for contained points.

Disable **Only Sample When Inside** and **Always Sample When Inside** to switch to standard proximity-based sampling instead.

### How It Works

1. **Gather paths**: Paths within range are collected via octree query. Optionally filtered to only closed loops or open lines.
2. **Find closest point on path**: For each candidate path, the closest point along its edges is computed — or a specific alpha position if enabled.
3. **Test containment**: The source point is tested against the path using 2D projection (point-in-polygon).
4. **Filter**: By default, paths that don't contain the point are skipped. Range limits are bypassed for contained points.
5. **Blend and write**: Qualifying paths are weighted by the distance curve and blended. Results are stored as point attributes.

{% hint style="info" %}

## Containment by default.  
Out of the box, this node only samples paths that enclose the source point. Points outside all paths will fail sampling. This is the inverse of [Sample Inside Path](sample-inside-path.md), where paths sample the points they contain.
{% endhint %}

**Usage Notes**

* **2D projection**: Containment testing projects onto a configurable 2D plane. **Height Inclusion** adds an optional vertical tolerance.
* **Sample at specific alpha**: Instead of closest point, sample at a fixed position along the path using alpha (0–1), time, or distance units.
* **Path-specific outputs**: Beyond standard sampler outputs, writes **Time**, **Segment Time**, **Num Inside**, and **Closed Loop**.

### Behavior

```
Source point P:
   Inside Path1 (closed)? ✓  → Sampled (range bypassed)
   Inside Path2 (closed)? ✗  → Skipped
   Near Path3 (open)?     ✗  → Skipped (can't contain)

   → P inherits attributes from Path1

Disable OnlySampleWhenInside:
   → All paths within range sampled by proximity
```

When enabled, only samples closed paths where the point lies inside.

Default: `true`
