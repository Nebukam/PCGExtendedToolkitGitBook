# Discard By Overlap

Discard entire datasets based on how they overlap with each other.

> This is basically self-pruning for collections.

### Overview

Analyzes how multiple point collections overlap with each other and **discards entire datasets** based on weighted scoring. This is self-pruning for collections — it decides which overlapping datasets to keep and which to throw away.

### How It Works

1. **Compute bounds**: Build bounds for every point in every dataset.
2. **Detect overlaps**: Test all dataset pairs for overlapping regions, then drill into per-point overlap detection.
3. **Score**: Compute a weighted score for each dataset from overlap metrics and intrinsic properties.
4. **Prune**: Remove the worst-scoring dataset, update all remaining scores, repeat until no overlaps remain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Pruning is iterative.** When a dataset is pruned, its overlaps with other datasets are removed. This changes everyone else's dynamic scores, so the node re-scores and re-sorts after every prune. A dataset that looked like a bad candidate might become a good one after its main overlap partner is removed.
{% endhint %}

**Usage Notes**

* **Dataset-level**: Operates on entire collections, not individual points.
* **Only ratios matter**: Weights are internally normalized within each category, so `OverlapCount = 4, OverlapSubCount = 2` is identical to `OverlapCount = 2, OverlapSubCount = 1`.
* **Custom scoring**: Tag scores and `@Data` attribute scores let you bias the system toward keeping or discarding specific datasets regardless of their overlap.

### How Scoring Works

Each dataset gets a single **Weight** value that determines its pruning priority. This weight is a blend of two categories:

**Dynamic scores** — computed from actual overlaps, change as datasets are pruned:

| Metric                   | What it measures                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overlap Count**        | How many other datasets this one overlaps with            |
| **Overlap Sub Count**    | Total number of individual point-to-point overlaps        |
| **Overlap Volume**       | Cumulative intersection volume across all overlapping points |
| **Overlap Volume Density** | Overlap volume divided by overlapping point count       |

**Static scores** — intrinsic to the dataset, don't change during pruning:

| Metric              | What it measures                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Num Points**      | How many points the dataset contains                 |
| **Volume**          | Total volume of all point bounds                     |
| **Volume Density**  | Points per unit of volume                            |
| **Custom Tag Score** | Sum of score values for matching tags               |
| **Data Score**      | Sum of `@Data` attribute values                      |

Each raw score is **normalized relative to the current maximum** across all remaining datasets (so the highest becomes 1.0). The final weight is:

```
Weight = (StaticWeight × StaticBalance) + (DynamicWeight × DynamicBalance)
```

**Dynamic Balance** and **Static Balance** control how much each category matters. The default (`Dynamic = 1`, `Static = 0.5`) means overlap data has roughly twice the influence of intrinsic properties.

### Behavior

```
Input:  A (50pts, overlaps B+C), B (30pts, overlaps A), C (100pts, overlaps A)

Round 1 — Score all:
   A: overlaps 2 datasets → highest dynamic score → pruned
Round 2 — Re-score:
   B and C no longer overlap → both output
```
