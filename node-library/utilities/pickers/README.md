# Pickers

**Sub-nodes that select specific points by index.** Cherry Pick Points is the main consumer — it takes picker sub-nodes as input and outputs only the selected points. Picker sub-nodes define the selection logic: constant indices, index ranges, indices from an attribute set, or ranges from a set. Pickers are the index-based complement to filters, which select by condition.
