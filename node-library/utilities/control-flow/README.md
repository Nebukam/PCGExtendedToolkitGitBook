# Control Flow

**Nodes that direct execution and data routing in a PCG graph.** Branch on Data and Uber Branch route collections down conditional paths based on filters or data properties. Break terminates processing early. Iterations loops a subgraph a set number of times. Wait for PCG Data pauses execution until external data becomes available. These are the structural nodes that let you build non-linear graphs.
