# Data Matching

**Nodes that pair and correlate datasets.** When an operation needs to know which collection goes with which, match rules define the pairing logic — by index, by shared tags, by attribute values, by spatial overlap, or randomly. These follow the provider/consumer pattern: match rule sub-nodes feed into consuming nodes that need dataset correspondence.

For the concepts behind matching and the broader selection system, see [Match & Select](../../../working-with-pcgex/additional-systems/match-and-select.md).
