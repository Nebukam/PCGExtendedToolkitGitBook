# Discarding

**Nodes that remove entire datasets or spawned actors.** Discard By Point Count drops collections that are too small or too large, Discard Same removes duplicate collections, Spatial Triage separates overlapping data into keep/discard sets, and Destroy Actor cleans up previously spawned actors. These operate at the collection level — for per-point removal, use filters instead.
