# FC : Count

> Stop fill after a certain number of vtx have been captured.

#### Overview

This subnode defines a stopping condition for flood fill operations based on a maximum count of vertices captured. It ensures that the fill process halts once a specified number of points are added to the diffusion set, regardless of spatial proximity or other criteria.

It is used with nodes that support flood fill behavior, such as those building clusters or paths from seed points. This subnode connects to the Probe pin of flood fill processing nodes.

#### How It Works

This subnode acts as a **capture filter** during flood fill diffusion. It evaluates whether a candidate point can be added to the current fill set based on how many points have already been captured.

When a new point is considered for capture, it checks if the total number of previously captured points (including the current one) would exceed the defined limit. If so, that candidate is rejected and not added to the diffusion.

The logic ensures that once the maximum count is reached, no more points are added to the fill, effectively capping the size of the resulting cluster or path. It does not affect how candidates are discovered or prioritized—only whether they are accepted for inclusion.

<summary>Inputs</summary>

* **Probe Pin**: This subnode connects to the Probe pin on flood fill processing nodes.
* It receives candidate points from spatial probing operations, such as those defined by a probe subnode (e.g., proximity or ray-based).

<summary>Outputs</summary>

* **None**: This subnode does not produce new data. It modifies the behavior of how candidates are accepted during flood fill diffusion.

#### Configuration

***

**Max Count Input**

_Controls whether the maximum count is a fixed value or read from an attribute._

When set to **Constant**, the `Max Count` setting is used directly. When set to **Attribute**, the `Max Count (Attr)` setting defines which attribute to read the value from.

**Values**:

* **Constant**: Uses the constant value defined in `Max Count`.
* **Attribute**: Reads the count from a point attribute named in `Max Count (Attr)`.

**Max Count (Attr)**

_The name of the attribute used to define the maximum count when input is set to Attribute._

This setting is only active when `Max Count Input` is set to **Attribute**.

**Max Count**

_The maximum number of points that can be captured during a fill operation._

This value must be at least 1. The flood fill will stop adding new points once this limit is reached, even if more candidates are available in the input data.

#### Usage Example

Use this subnode when you want to limit how many points are included in a cluster or path generated by a flood fill process. For example:

* You're generating a cluster of points from a seed and want it to contain no more than 50 points.
* You're building a path that should not exceed 20 segments.

Connect this subnode to the Probe pin of your flood fill node, set the `Max Count` to your desired number (e.g., 50), and ensure that the input data has enough candidates to allow for the full diffusion up to that limit.

#### Notes

* This subnode only affects capture behavior; it does not influence how candidates are discovered or prioritized.
* If a point attribute is used, make sure the attribute exists on all input points to avoid runtime errors.
* The count includes all successfully captured points, including the initial seed.
