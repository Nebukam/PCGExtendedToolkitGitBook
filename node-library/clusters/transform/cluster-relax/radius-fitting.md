# Radius Fitting

Relaxes cluster vertices by detecting and resolving overlaps between spheres centered on each vertex.

### Overview

This relaxation operation treats each vertex as a sphere with a configurable radius. When spheres overlap, vertices are pushed apart proportionally to the overlap amount. This is simpler and faster than box-based collision but works best for roughly spherical or uniform-sized elements.

> This is a [relax-operation.md](relax-operation.md "mention")

### How It Works

1. **Radius Assignment**: Each vertex gets a collision radius from an attribute or constant value.
2. **Overlap Detection**: Tests all pairs of vertices for sphere intersection (distance < sum of radii).
3. **Force Calculation**: When spheres overlap, calculates a repulsion force based on overlap depth and distance.
4. **Position Update**: Applies accumulated forces to push overlapping vertices apart.
5. **Iteration**: Repeats for the configured number of iterations until convergence.

**Usage Notes**

* **Radius Attribute**: Use `$Extents.Length` to derive radius from point bounds, or specify a custom attribute.
* **Uniform Elements**: Works best when elements are roughly spherical; for elongated shapes, consider Box Fitting.
* **Performance**: Faster than box-based methods due to simpler overlap calculations.

### Behavior

```
Before:                         After Relaxation:

   (A)====(B)                   (A)    (B)
   (spheres overlap)            (spheres separated)

Overlapping spheres push apart along their center-to-center vector.
```

#### Inherited Settings

This operation inherits common fitting relaxation settings from its base class, including:

* Repulsion Constant
* Edge Fitting mode
* Spring Constant
* Time Step
