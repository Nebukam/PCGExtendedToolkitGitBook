# Cluster : Connect Points

Connect points according to a set of probes.

### Overview

Connect Points creates cluster graphs by connecting input points based on configurable probe rules. Each point queries neighboring points using one or more probe operations to determine which connections to establish. The result is a cluster with vertices (the original points) and edges representing the connections.

### How It Works

1. **Filter Evaluation**: Evaluates Generator and Connectable filters to determine which points participate in each role.
2. **Probe Setup**: Loads probe factories from the input pin to define connection rules.
3. **Spatial Indexing**: Builds an octree for efficient neighbor queries (if needed by probes).
4. **Connection Testing**: Each generator point uses the configured probes to find candidate connectable points.
5. **Edge Deduplication**: Removes duplicate edges to produce a clean graph.
6. **Graph Output**: Outputs vertices and edges as a cluster data structure.

**Usage Notes**

* **Probe Factories Required**: At least one probe factory must be connected to the input pin for the node to produce edges.
* **Probe Combination**: Multiple probes can be combined - each probe type contributes its own connection logic.
* **Generator vs Connectable**: Use the filter pins to create asymmetric connectivity — for example, only certain "hub" points generate connections while all points can receive them.
* **2D Projection**: When enabled, connection tests ignore the projected axis, useful for top-down or side-view connections.

### Behavior

```
Input Points + Probes (no filters):

  ●A        ●B        ●C        ●D

With KNN Probe (K=2):

  ●A────────●B────────●C────────●D
      edge      edge      edge

Output: Cluster with 4 vertices, 3 edges


With Generator Filter (only B can generate) + Connectable Filter (all can receive):

  ●A        ●B        ●C        ●D
      ←─────┼─────→
            │
  ●A────────●B────────●C
      edge      edge

Only B creates edges; A, C, D can receive but not initiate.
```

### Inputs

| Pin                     | Type             | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **In**                  | Point Data       | Points to connect into clusters                                                                               |
| **Probes**              | Probe Factories  | One or more probe configurations defining connection rules                                                    |
| **Generator Filters**   | Filter Factories | Points that pass these filters can generate (create) connections. Points that fail won't initiate any edges.  |
| **Connectable Filters** | Filter Factories | Points that pass these filters can receive connections. Points that fail won't be connected to by generators. |

### Settings

#### Node-Specific Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Prevent Coincidence</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, prevents connections between points that are at the same position (within tolerance). This avoids zero-length edges from duplicate points.

Default: `true`

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Coincidence Tolerance</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

Distance threshold below which two points are considered coincident and won't be connected.

Default: `0.001`

📋 _Visible when Prevent Coincidence is enabled_

<summary><strong>Project Points</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, projects points to 2D for connection testing. Useful when you want to ignore height differences when determining connections.

Default: `false`
