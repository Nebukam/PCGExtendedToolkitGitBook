# G-Probe : KNN

K-Nearest Neighbors connectivity.

### Overview

This global probe connects each point to its K nearest neighbors based on Euclidean distance. KNN is one of the most fundamental connectivity algorithms, creating local neighborhood relationships without requiring a search radius. The "Mutual" mode adds an additional constraint requiring both points to consider each other as nearest neighbors for a connection to be created.

### How It Works

1. **Distance Calculation**: Computes distances from each point to all other points
2. **Neighbor Selection**: For each point, identifies the K closest neighbors
3. **Connection Creation**: Creates edges based on the selected mode (default or mutual)
4. **Edge Deduplication**: Removes duplicate edges from bidirectional neighbor relationships

**Usage Notes**

* **No Search Radius**: Unlike other probes, KNN doesn't use a search radius - it always finds exactly K neighbors regardless of distance
* **Mutual Mode**: Requires both points to list each other in their K-nearest for a connection, resulting in fewer but more "reciprocal" connections
* **Variable K**: K can be specified as a constant or read from a per-point attribute, allowing adaptive connectivity density

### Behavior

    Input Points:              Default Mode:             Mutual Mode:

       •     •                    •─────•                    •     •
          •                       │╲   ╱│                     ╲   ╱
       •     •                    • ╲ ╱ •                      ╲ ╱
                                     ╳                          ╳
       •     •                    • ╱ ╲ •                      ╱ ╲
          •                       │╱   ╲│                     ╱   ╲
       •     •                    •─────•                    •     •

                              Each point → K nearest    Only mutual nearest
