| Diagrams               | Geometric construction: Delaunay, Voronoi, Convex Hull, Cell Diagram, Dual Graph          |
| Connect Points         | Probe-based connectivity with configurable criteria                                       |
| **Mesh to Clusters**   | Create clusters from static mesh topology (raw triangles, dual graph, hollow, boundaries) |
| **Build Custom Graph** | Create clusters using custom blueprint graph builders                                     |
