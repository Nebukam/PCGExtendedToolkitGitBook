# Cluster : Break to Paths

Create individual paths from continuous edge chains.

### Overview

This node extracts path point collections from cluster graphs by finding continuous edge chains. It identifies sequences of edges that form paths (nodes with exactly two neighbors) and outputs each chain as a separate point collection. This is the primary way to convert cluster topology back into path-based data for use with path nodes.

### How It Works

1. **Chain Detection**: Identifies continuous sequences of edges where nodes have exactly two connections
2. **Break Point Handling**: Uses optional filters to define custom break points within chains
3. **Direction Resolution**: Orders points within each path according to direction settings
4. **Winding Enforcement** (optional): Ensures consistent winding order for closed loops
5. **Output Filtering**: Applies min/max point count filters before outputting paths

**Usage Notes**

* **Leaves Handling**: Leaf nodes (endpoints with one connection) can be included, excluded, or processed exclusively.
* **Operation Target**: Choose between extracting full path chains or treating each edge as an individual path.
* **Break Conditions**: Connect cluster node filters to define additional points where chains should be broken.
* **Winding**: When enabled, projects paths to 2D and enforces clockwise or counter-clockwise ordering.
