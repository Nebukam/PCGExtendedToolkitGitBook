# Decomp : BSP Occupancy

Partition clusters using axis-aligned BSP splits through empty space.

### Overview

Voxelizes the cluster, then recursively splits the voxel grid along axis-aligned planes that pass through empty space. The algorithm prefers to cut through gaps and holes in the cluster's spatial footprint, producing cells that correspond to dense, spatially contiguous groups of nodes. A contiguity post-pass ensures no cell contains disconnected voxel islands.

### How It Works

1. **Voxelization**: The cluster is mapped onto a 3D occupancy grid. Voxel resolution is either inferred from edge lengths or set manually.
2. **Recursive BSP**: The grid is recursively bisected along the axis and position that best separates occupied voxels. Split scoring favors balanced partitions and cuts through empty slices (controlled by Gap Weight).
3. **Leaf Assignment**: Recursion stops when a region reaches Max Depth or contains fewer occupied voxels than Min Voxels Per Cell. All occupied voxels in the region are assigned the same cell ID.
4. **Contiguity Pass**: Each leaf cell is flood-filled. If occupied voxels within a cell are spatially disconnected, they are split into separate cells.
5. **Mapping**: Voxel cell IDs are mapped back to cluster node indices.
