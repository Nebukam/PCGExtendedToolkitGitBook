# Decomp : Max Boxes

Partition clusters by extracting largest axis-aligned boxes.

### Overview

Voxelizes the cluster and iteratively extracts the largest axis-aligned box of occupied voxels. Each extracted box becomes a cell. Boxes exceeding the maximum cell size are subdivided. Adjacent cells that form a perfect larger box are merged. The result is a set of compact, solid-filled rectangular regions.

### How It Works

1. **Voxelization**: The cluster is mapped onto a 3D occupancy grid.
2. **Largest Box Extraction**: For each Z-range, a 2D largest-rectangle-in-histogram algorithm finds the biggest box of occupied voxels. The highest-scoring box is extracted and its voxels are marked as consumed.
3. **Scoring**: Boxes are scored by `Volume * Compactness^(Balance * 2)`, where compactness is the ratio of the smallest to largest dimension. Higher Balance values prefer cube-like shapes over elongated strips.
4. **Subdivision**: Extracted boxes larger than Max Cell Size are subdivided into smaller chunks.
5. **Merging**: Adjacent cells whose combined bounding box is exactly filled (no gaps) are merged back together.
6. **Mapping**: Voxel cell IDs are mapped back to cluster node indices. Cells with fewer occupied voxels than the minimum are discarded.
