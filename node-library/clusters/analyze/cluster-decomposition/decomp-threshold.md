# Decomp : Threshold

Partition clusters by binning a numeric attribute.

### Overview

Reads a numeric attribute from each cluster node and assigns cell IDs based on value ranges. Supports two binning strategies: Uniform (equal-width bins across the value range) and Quantile (equal-count bins where each cell gets roughly the same number of nodes). This is a purely attribute-driven decomposition with no spatial or topological awareness.

### How It Works

1. **Attribute Read**: Reads the selected numeric attribute from each cluster node.
2. **Binning**:
   * **Uniform**: Divides the attribute's value range into equal-width bins. Each node is assigned to the bin its value falls into.
   * **Quantile**: Sorts nodes by attribute value and divides them into equal-count groups.
3. **Cell Assignment**: Each bin becomes a cell ID. The actual cell count may be less than Num Bins if many nodes share identical values.
