# Diagrams

Key takeaways\
\- Diagram loose their intrinsic properties once they're created, so options relying on intrinsic mathematical properties stop being available afterward even tho these properties still hold true\
\- i.e, a voronoi cell becomes just "a cell", and there is no concept of triangles
