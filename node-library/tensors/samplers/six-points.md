# Six Points

Samples the field using six points around the sampling target location, and averaging the results.

⚙️ **Behavior** — Instanced directional tensor.

**How It Works**

> AI-Generated, needs proofreading

* Samples the field at six distinct locations surrounding the target sampling point.
* Computes the average value of the samples obtained from these six points.
* Outputs the averaged result as the final sampled value for the target location.

_No configurable settings._
