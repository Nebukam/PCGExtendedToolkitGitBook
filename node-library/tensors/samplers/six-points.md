# Six Points

{% hint style="info" %}
This page was generated from the source code. It should properly capture what the node does, but still needs to be proofread by a human.

> Samples the tensor field using six points around the target location and averages the results.

#### Overview

This subnode defines how to sample tensor data at a specific point in space by evaluating the field at six surrounding locations. Instead of taking a single sample, it gathers values from multiple directions and computes an average, which helps smooth out noise and provides more stable results for downstream processing.

It's particularly useful when you want to reduce the impact of local anomalies or irregularities in tensor fields, such as those generated by noise functions or procedural forces. By averaging over multiple points, it can produce more consistent and visually pleasing outputs.

Connects to **Tensor Sampling** nodes that require a sampler subnode.

#### How It Works

This subnode performs a multi-point sampling operation around the target location. It defines six fixed directions: forward, backward, up, down, left, and right, each offset by a distance equal to the defined radius. For each of these six points, it evaluates the tensor field using the base sampling logic.

The results from all six evaluations are then averaged together to produce a final sample value. This approach reduces noise and provides a smoother representation of the tensor field at the target point. The averaging process ensures that local variations in the field are balanced out, leading to more predictable behavior when used in procedural generation workflows.

* **Tensors**: Array of tensor operations to sample from
* **Seed Index**: Index used for deterministic sampling
* **Probe Transform**: The location and orientation where sampling begins

* **Sampled Tensor Value**: Averaged tensor result from the six surrounding points

#### Configuration

<details>

<summary><strong>Radius</strong><br><em>Distance between the center point and each of the six sampling locations.</em></summary>

Controls how far away from the main probe location the six sample points are placed. A larger radius will capture more distant field influences, while a smaller radius focuses on local variations.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Min Step Fraction</strong><br><em>Minimum step size as fraction of base radius.</em></summary>

Sets the smallest allowed distance between sampling points when adaptive sampling is enabled. This parameter ensures that samples don't get too close together, which could cause instability or artifacts.

**Values**:

* **0.01 to 1.0**: Fraction of the base radius

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Max Step Fraction</strong><br><em>Maximum step size as fraction of base radius.</em></summary>

Defines the largest allowed distance between sampling points during adaptive sampling. This sets an upper bound on how far apart samples can be, preventing overly sparse evaluations.

**Values**:

* **0.1 to 2.0**: Fraction of the base radius

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Error Tolerance</strong><br><em>Error tolerance for step size adaptation.</em></summary>

Controls how much deviation is allowed before adjusting the sampling step size. Lower values result in more precise but potentially slower sampling, while higher values allow faster but less accurate evaluations.

**Values**:

* **0.001 to 0.5**: Fraction of the base radius

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Max Sub-Steps</strong><br><em>Maximum sub-steps per sample.</em></summary>

Limits how many times the sampling step can be subdivided during adaptive sampling. This controls computational cost and prevents infinite loops in complex fields.

**Values**:

* **1 to 16**: Number of allowed subdivisions

</details>

#### Usage Example

Use this subnode when you want to smooth out tensor field evaluations for better visual consistency. For example, when applying forces or influences from a noise-based tensor field, connecting this sampler ensures that the influence at any given point is averaged over several nearby locations, reducing flickering or abrupt changes in behavior.

#### Notes

* The six sampling points are fixed and always aligned with the cardinal axes (forward, backward, up, down, left, right).
* This subnode works best when combined with tensor fields that have some degree of spatial coherence.
* Consider using this with larger radius values if you're working with very noisy or chaotic tensor fields.
