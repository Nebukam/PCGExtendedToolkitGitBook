# Tensor Sampler (RK4)

Samples the field using Runge-Kutta 4 method.

### Overview

The RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4) tensor sampler uses a fourth-order numerical integration method to sample the tensor field. This classical method takes four intermediate samples per step to compute a more accurate direction than single-point sampling. RK4 provides consistent, high-quality results with fixed step sizes, making it predictable and well-suited for smooth tensor fields.

### How It Works

1. **Initial Sample**: Samples the tensor field at the current position.
2. **Midpoint Samples**: Takes two additional samples at the midpoint of the step using the initial direction.
3. **Endpoint Sample**: Takes a final sample at the projected endpoint.
4. **Weighted Average**: Combines all four samples using the RK4 weighting formula (1/6, 2/6, 2/6, 1/6) to produce the final direction.

**Usage Notes**

* **Fixed Step Size**: Unlike Adaptive RK, this sampler uses consistent step sizes. Best for fields with uniform complexity.
* **Higher Accuracy**: More accurate than single-point sampling due to the four-sample integration, reducing drift in curved fields.
* **Predictable Performance**: Fixed computation cost per step makes performance easy to estimate.

### Behavior

```
RK4 Integration per Step:

Position P₀ ──────────────────────────────────> P₁
            │
            ├─ k1: Sample at P₀
            ├─ k2: Sample at P₀ + 0.5*k1
            ├─ k3: Sample at P₀ + 0.5*k2
            └─ k4: Sample at P₀ + k3

Final direction = (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6

Result: Smoother path through curved tensor fields
        compared to single-sample methods.
```
