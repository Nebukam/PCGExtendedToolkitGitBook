# Tensor : Path Pole

A tensor that represents a vector/flow field toward or away from a path.

### Overview

The Path Pole Tensor creates a directional field where directions point toward or away from paths defined by input points. Unlike Path Flow which provides directions along the path, Path Pole creates radial attraction or repulsion fields around the path, where sample points are directed toward (or away from) the nearest point on the path.

### How It Works

1. **Path Conversion**: Converts input point sequences into spline representations.
2. **Closest Point Query**: For each sample position, finds the closest point on any path spline.
3. **Direction Calculation**: Calculates the direction vector from the sample point toward (or away from) the closest path point.
4. **Falloff Application**: Applies distance-based falloff using the configured radius.

**Usage Notes**

* **Attraction/Repulsion**: Creates pull toward or push away from paths depending on tensor weight sign and mutations.
* **Path-Based Input**: Input points are treated as ordered paths — each collection becomes a separate spline.
* **Radius**: Defines the influence distance from the path. Points beyond this radius receive no directional influence.

### Behavior

**Path Pole Tensor (attraction):**

```
Input path:  ●───●───●───●
                 │
Tensor field:    │
  ↘ ↘ ↘ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↙ ↙ ↙
  → → → → → → ← ← ←
  ↗ ↗ ↗ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↖ ↖ ↖
                 │
                 │
             ●───●

Directions point toward the nearest
point on the path.
```

<summary><strong>Radius</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

Base influence radius of the path. Points beyond this distance receive no directional influence. The effective radius may be scaled by control point scale.

Default: `100`
