# Tensor : Null

A tensor that represent a Null field

📌 **Subnode** — Connects to **Tensors** pins.

**How It Works**

> AI-Generated, needs proofreading

* The node initializes a tensor object that specifically represents a Null field.
* Configuration settings for this tensor are defined through the "Config: Tensor properties" section, which likely includes dimensions and data type specifications relevant to representing null values.
* The node outputs a tensor filled with null or zero values, depending on the configuration, maintaining the shape and type as specified in the settings.
