# Tensor : Pole

A tensor that pull and/or pushes

📌 **Subnode** — Connects to **Tensors** pins.

**How It Works**

> AI-Generated, needs proofreading

* The node initializes a tensor object labeled as "Pole".
* Config settings define properties of the tensor, which influence how it operates within its environment.
* The tensor applies forces to other elements in its vicinity; it can both attract (pull) and repel (push) based on predefined parameters.
