# Noise : FBM

While not 100% accurate, it should properly capture what the node/factory does. It stills needs to be proofread by a human.
{% endhint %}

> Creates fractal Brownian motion noise with multiple variants including standard, ridged, billow, hybrid, and warped.

### Overview

This factory generates procedural noise patterns using Fractal Brownian Motion (fBm) techniques. It supports several noise variants that produce different visual characteristics, making it useful for terrain generation, displacement effects, surface variations, and other procedural content needs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Connects to **Noise** input pins on nodes that require noise sampling.
{% endhint %}

### How It Works

Fractal Brownian Motion builds complex noise patterns by combining multiple layers (octaves) of noise at different frequencies and amplitudes. Each octave contributes to the final result, creating natural-looking variations and details.

The factory supports five distinct variants:

* **Standard fBm**: Classic fractal noise
* **Ridged Multifractal**: Creates sharp ridges and peaks
* **Billow (Turbulence)**: Produces turbulent, swirling patterns
* **Hybrid Multifractal**: Combines ridge and fractal characteristics
* **Domain Warped**: Applies warping to the input coordinates before noise evaluation

### Configuration

***

#### General Settings

**Octaves**

_The number of noise layers to combine._

More octaves create more detailed and complex patterns. Typical values range from 1 to 8, with higher numbers producing more intricate results.

**Lacunarity**

_The frequency multiplier between octaves._

Controls how quickly the pattern changes at each octave level. Higher values (2.0–4.0) create more rapid transitions between noise layers. Default is 2.0.

**Persistence**

_The amplitude multiplier between octaves._

Determines how much each successive octave contributes to the final result. Lower values (0.0–1.0) make higher octaves less influential, resulting in smoother patterns. Default is 0.5.

**Variant**

_The type of fractal noise to generate._

**Values**:

* **Standard fBm**: Classic fractal Brownian motion
* **Ridged Multifractal**: Sharp ridges and peaks
* **Billow (Turbulence)**: Turbulent, swirling patterns
* **Hybrid Multifractal**: Mix of ridge and fractal characteristics
* **Domain Warped**: Warps input coordinates before noise evaluation

**Ridge Offset**

_The offset applied to the ridged variant._

Only active when **Variant** is set to **Ridged Multifractal**. Adjusts the sharpness of ridges. Values typically range from 0.0 to 2.0.

**Warp Strength**

_The amount of warping applied in the warped variant._

Only active when **Variant** is set to **Domain Warped**. Controls how much the input coordinates are distorted before noise evaluation. Values typically range from 0.0 to 2.0.

### Usage Example

Use this factory to create terrain heightmaps or surface displacement patterns:

1. Place a "Noise : FBM" node in your graph
2. Connect it to a **Noise** pin on a node like "Point Noise" or "Mesh Noise"
3. Set **Octaves** to 6 for detailed terrain features
4. Choose **Ridged Multifractal** for mountain-like peaks
5. Adjust **Lacunarity** to 2.2 and **Persistence** to 0.4 for natural-looking variation

This setup will generate a noise pattern suitable for creating rugged, mountainous terrain with sharp ridges and smooth transitions.

### Notes

* Higher octave counts increase computation time but add more detail
* The **Warped** variant can create very organic-looking patterns by distorting the input space
* Combine multiple FBM factories with different settings to layer complex noise effects
* Use **Blend Mode** and **Weight Factor** when stacking multiple noise sources for fine control over their combined effect

### Inputs

* **Noise** (Required): Input noise source used for sampling.

### Outputs

* **Noise**: Output noise pattern generated by the factory.
