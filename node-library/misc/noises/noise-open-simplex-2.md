# Noise : Open Simplex 2

While not 100% accurate, it should properly capture what the node/factory does. It stills needs to be proofread by a human.

> Creates high-quality, patent-free gradient noise suitable for procedural content generation.

### Overview

This factory generates OpenSimplex2 noise, a smooth, visually isotropic noise function that serves as a patent-free alternative to classic Simplex noise. It's ideal for creating natural-looking variations in terrain, textures, vegetation placement, and other procedural effects.

{% hint style="info" %}
Connects to **Noise** input pins on nodes like **PCGEx | Noise3D**, **PCGEx | Noise3D (In Place)**, or any node that accepts noise operations.
{% endhint %}

### How It Works

OpenSimplex2 produces smooth, continuous noise values across 3D space using a gradient-based approach. Unlike some noise functions, it's designed to have better visual isotropy, meaning it doesn't show directional artifacts or grid-like patterns when scaled up.

The noise is generated by combining multiple octaves of noise at different frequencies and amplitudes, controlled through the persistence and lacunarity parameters. Each octave adds finer detail to the overall pattern.

### Inputs

* **Noise** (optional): Input noise to blend with the generated noise
* **Seed** (optional): Random seed value for deterministic noise patterns

### Outputs

* **Noise**: Generated noise value that can be used by downstream nodes

### Configuration

#### General

**Octaves**

_Controls how many layers of noise are combined._

More octaves add finer detail but also increase computational cost. With 1 octave, you get a smooth base pattern. With 4 octaves, you get more intricate variations.

**Values**:

* **1**: Single layer noise (smoothest)
* **2**: Basic detail
* **4**: Rich texture with fine details
* **8**: Very detailed noise

**Lacunarity**

_Controls the frequency multiplier between octaves._

Higher values increase the frequency of higher-detail noise layers. A value of 2 doubles the frequency with each octave.

**Values**:

* **1.0**: No change in frequency per octave
* **2.0**: Frequency doubles per octave (default)
* **4.0**: Frequency quadruples per octave

**Persistence**

_Controls the amplitude multiplier between octaves._

Higher values preserve more of the higher-detail noise layers, making the final result more rugged or rough. A value of 0.5 halves the amplitude with each octave.

**Values**:

* **0.0**: No contribution from higher octaves
* **0.5**: Default - moderate roughness
* **1.0**: Full amplitude (very rough noise)

### Usage Example

Use this factory to create natural terrain variations. For example, connect it to a **PCGEx | Noise3D** node with 4 octaves, lacunarity of 2.0, and persistence of 0.5 to generate smooth but detailed height variations for a landscape.

### Notes

* OpenSimplex2 is designed to be free of patents, unlike some other noise implementations
* The default settings (1 octave, 2.0 lacunarity, 0.5 persistence) produce a balanced, natural-looking pattern
* Higher octaves can create more complex patterns but may also introduce artifacts if not tuned carefully
* Combine multiple noise factories using the **Noise3D** node's blend modes to create rich, varied results
