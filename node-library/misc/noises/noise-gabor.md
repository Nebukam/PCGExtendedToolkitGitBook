# Noise : Gabor

{% hint style="warning" %}
## AI-generated page -- to be reviewed 
While not 100% accurate, it should properly capture what the node/factory does. It stills needs to be proofread by a human.
{% endhint %}

> Creates directional, anisotropic noise patterns using Gabor kernels. Ideal for simulating natural textures with strong directional characteristics.

### Overview

This factory generates procedural noise that emphasizes directionality and anisotropy. It's particularly useful for creating patterns like wood grain, fabric weaves, brushed metal, or any directional surface texture.

{% hint style="info" %}
Connects to **Noise** input pins on nodes that sample noise values (e.g., Noise Modifier, Noise Filter).
{% endhint %}

### How It Works

Gabor noise combines a sinusoidal carrier wave with a Gaussian envelope to create directional patterns. The kernel's orientation determines the primary direction of the pattern, while bandwidth controls how sharp or diffuse the directional characteristics are.

The noise is generated by placing impulses in a 3D grid and combining their contributions using Gabor kernels. Each impulse contributes a directional wave pattern that blends with others to form complex anisotropic textures.

### Inputs

* **Noise** (Optional): Input noise to modify or combine with the generated Gabor pattern
* **Seed** (Optional): Random seed value for reproducible results

### Outputs

* **Noise**: The resulting Gabor noise pattern that can be used by downstream nodes

### Configuration

***

#### General

**Direction**

_Controls the primary direction of the noise pattern._

Set this to define which direction the noise features will align with. For example, setting (1,0,0) creates horizontal patterns, while (0,1,0) creates vertical patterns. The vector is automatically normalized.

**Bandwidth**

_Controls how directional the pattern is._

Lower values (0.1-1.0) create more directional, sharp patterns. Higher values (2.0-10.0) produce more diffuse, less directional noise. Values below 0.1 may cause artifacts.

**Values**:

* **Low (0.1-1.0)**: Strong directional features
* **Medium (1.0-3.0)**: Balanced directionality
* **High (3.0+)**: Diffuse, less directional

**Impulses Per Cell**

_Number of directional impulses per grid cell._

Controls the density and complexity of the pattern. Higher values create more detailed textures but may increase computation time.

**Values**:

* **1-4**: Sparse, simple patterns
* **5-16**: Medium detail
* **17-32**: Dense, complex patterns

**Kernel Radius**

_Distance over which each impulse contributes._

Controls the spread of influence from each impulse. Larger values create smoother transitions between pattern features.

**Values**:

* **0.5-1.0**: Sharp, localized features
* **1.0-2.0**: Moderate smoothing
* **2.0-4.0**: Smooth, large-scale patterns

### Usage Example

Create a wood grain texture by setting:

* Direction to (1,0,0) for horizontal grain
* Bandwidth to 0.5 for strong directional features
* Impulses Per Cell to 8
* Kernel Radius to 2.0 for smooth transitions

Connect this factory to a Noise Modifier node to apply the pattern to point positions or attributes.

### Notes

* Gabor noise is computationally more expensive than standard noise types due to its directional nature
* For best results, use bandwidth values between 0.5 and 3.0
* Combine multiple Gabor factories with different directions for complex anisotropic patterns
* The Direction vector defines the primary orientation; perpendicular directions will have weaker influence
* Higher Impulses Per Cell values increase visual complexity but may impact performance on large datasets
