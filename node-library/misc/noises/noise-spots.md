# Noise : Spots

{% hint style="danger" %}
This documentation has been AI-generated from the source code and may not be 100% accurate.
{% endhint %}

> Creates procedural noise patterns with circular or shaped spots, useful for generating polka dots, animal patterns, cell structures, and stylized textures.

### Overview

This factory generates noise that produces distinct spot patterns with customizable shapes and properties. The output is a scalar value representing the intensity of spots at any given point in space.

{% hint style="info" %}
Connects to **Noise** input pins on other nodes like **Noise : Sample**, **Noise : Combine**, or **Noise : Remap**
{% endhint %}

### How It Works

This noise factory creates a grid of cells, with each cell containing one spot. The spot's position can be jittered within the cell, and its size can vary randomly. The pattern is generated by computing the distance from any point to the nearest spot center and applying a shape function based on the configured spot type.

### Inputs

* **Noise** (Optional): Input noise to modify or combine with the spot pattern
* **Seed**: Random seed value for reproducible results
* **Scale**: Overall scale of the noise pattern
* **Offset**: Offset position for the noise pattern

### Outputs

* **Noise**: Generated noise pattern with spot characteristics

### Configuration

***

#### General

**Shape**

_The geometric shape of each spot._

* **Circle (Hard)**: Sharp-edged circular spots with hard transitions
* **Circle (Soft Falloff)**: Smoothly fading circular spots
* **Square**: Square-shaped spots
* **Diamond**: Diamond-shaped spots
* **Star**: Star-shaped spots

**Spot Radius**

_Base radius of each spot (0-1, relative to cell size)._

Controls how large the spots appear. A value of 0.4 means spots cover 40% of the cell's width/height.

**Radius Variation**

_Random variation in spot radius._

Adds randomness to spot sizes. A value of 0.1 means each spot can be 10% larger or smaller than the base radius.

**Jitter**

_Jitter of spot positions within cells._

Controls how much spots can move from their cell center. A value of 0.3 means spots can be placed up to 30% of a cell's width/height away from center.

**Invert Spots**

_When enabled, creates holes instead of dots._

Instead of bright spots, this generates dark areas (holes) where no spots exist.

**Value Variation**

_Random value variation per spot._

Adds randomness to each spot's intensity. A value of 0.2 means each spot can be 20% brighter or dimmer than its base value.

### Usage Example

Create a **Noise : Spots** factory with:

* Shape: Circle (Soft Falloff)
* Spot Radius: 0.3
* Radius Variation: 0.15
* Jitter: 0.25

Connect it to a **Noise : Sample** node to generate a smooth, randomized dot pattern for texture variation or object placement.

### Notes

* The noise is generated in a grid-based system where each cell contains one spot
* Higher jitter values create more organic-looking patterns
* Soft falloff shapes work well for natural-looking textures
* Combine multiple spots factories with different settings to create complex layered patterns
* Use **Noise : Combine** to blend this with other noise types for richer results
