> Create points in a circular shape.

### Overview

This node generates points that form a circular pattern around seed points. It's useful for creating rings, arcs, or circular arrangements of objects in your procedural content. You can control the number of points, the radius, and the angular range of the circle.

{% hint style="info" %}
The circle is generated by placing points evenly along the circumference of a circle defined by the seed point's location and scale.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Inputs</summary>

* **Seeds** (Points): The input points that define the center and scale of each circle.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Outputs</summary>

* **Output Points** (Points): The generated points forming the circle.
* **Shape Builder** (Data): A shape builder used by downstream nodes to process or modify the circle.

### Properties Overview

Settings for defining the circular shape and how it's generated.

***

#### General Settings

Controls the core properties of the circle shape.

**Resolution Mode**

_Controls how the number of points on the circle is determined._

* **Fixed**: Use a constant number of points.
* **Scaled**: Scale the number of points based on the seed point's scale.

**Resolution Input Type**

_Determines whether to use a constant value or read from an attribute._

* **Constant**: Use a fixed value for resolution.
* **Attribute**: Read the resolution value from an attribute on the input data.

**Resolution (Constant)**

_Number of points to generate along the circle's circumference._

* When using **Fixed** resolution mode, this sets the exact number of points.
* When using **Scaled** resolution mode, this acts as a multiplier for the seed scale.
* Minimum value is 0. Higher values create smoother circles.

**Resolution (Attribute)**

_The attribute to read the resolution from when using Attribute input type._

* This attribute should contain numeric values that determine how many points are generated per circle.

**Start Angle Input Type**

_Determines whether to use a constant value or read from an attribute for the starting angle._

* **Constant**: Use a fixed start angle.
* **Attribute**: Read the start angle from an attribute on the input data.

**Start Angle (Constant)**

_The starting angle of the circle, in degrees._

* Defines where the first point of the circle is placed.
* 0° points to the right (positive X-axis).
* Values are interpreted in degrees and can be negative or greater than 360.

**Start Angle (Attribute)**

_The attribute to read the start angle from when using Attribute input type._

* This attribute should contain numeric values representing angles in degrees.

**End Angle Input Type**

_Determines whether to use a constant value or read from an attribute for the ending angle._

* **Constant**: Use a fixed end angle.
* **Attribute**: Read the end angle from an attribute on the input data.

**End Angle (Constant)**

_The ending angle of the circle, in degrees._

* Defines where the last point of the circle is placed.
* 0° points to the right (positive X-axis).
* Values are interpreted in degrees and can be negative or greater than 360.
* When set to 360°, the circle is closed.

**End Angle (Attribute)**

_The attribute to read the end angle from when using Attribute input type._

* This attribute should contain numeric values representing angles in degrees.

**Is Closed Loop**

_When enabled, creates a closed loop by connecting the start and end points._

* If enabled and the start and end angles are not exactly 0° and 360°, the node will still attempt to close the loop.
* Useful for creating full circles or arcs that form a complete shape.

### Notes

* The circle is generated using the seed point's position as the center and its scale to determine the radius.
* You can use attributes to vary the resolution, start angle, and end angle per seed point for more dynamic results.
* For smooth curves, especially with high-resolution circles, consider using a higher number of points.
* Combine this node with other shape processors to create complex patterns or modify the generated points further.
