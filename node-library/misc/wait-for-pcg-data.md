# Wait for PCG Data

## Wait for PCG Data

> Waits for PCG Components generated by a specified graph instance, then outputs their data.

### Overview

This node searches for actors and PCG components that match a given graph template and waits until the components have finished generating their output data. It's useful when you need to ensure that dynamic PCG content is fully processed before continuing with downstream operations.

The node can wait for:

* Actors that contain PCG components using your target graph
* Components that are already active or need to be triggered for generation

It supports filtering by component tags and generation triggers, and allows you to define how to handle different trigger conditions like "GenerateOnLoad" or "GenerateAtRuntime".

{% hint style="info" %}
This node is essential when working with dynamic PCG content where downstream nodes depend on generated data that may not be immediately available.

<details>

<summary>Inputs</summary>

* **Points**: Input points to process. The node uses these as a source for actor references and optional data tagging.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Outputs</summary>

* **Output Points**: Points with associated PCG component data.
* **Roaming Data** (optional): Extra data not part of the main template, if enabled.

### Properties Overview

Settings grouped by category to control behavior and filtering.

***

#### Settings

Controls how the node searches for and handles PCG components.

**Actor Reference Attribute**

_The attribute name used to find actor references in input points._

* Specifies which point attribute contains the actor reference.
* Can be a constant value or an attribute from the input data.

**Values**:

* **Constant**: Use a fixed actor reference.
* **Attribute**: Read actor reference from a point attribute.

**Template Graph**

_The PCG graph instance to look for in components._

* The node searches for PCG components that use this graph.
* Only components using this exact graph will be considered.

**Must Match Template**

_If enabled, only components using the specified template graph are processed._

* When disabled, all components are considered regardless of their graph.

**Must Have Tag**

_Only process components with a specific tag._

* If set to None, no filtering by tag is applied.
* Useful for targeting specific component instances in complex setups.

**Do Match Generation Trigger**

_If enabled, filter components based on their generation trigger._

* Allows you to select only components that match or don't match a specific trigger condition.

**Match Generation Trigger**

_The generation trigger to match when filtering components._

* **GenerateOnLoad**: Component generates when the actor loads.
* **GenerateOnDemand**: Component generates when explicitly requested.
* **GenerateAtRuntime**: Component generates during runtime.

**Invert Generation Trigger**

_If enabled, only process components that do NOT match the specified trigger._

* Useful for excluding certain types of components from processing.

**Wait For Missing Actors**

_If enabled, wait for actor references to exist before proceeding._

* When disabled, the node skips actors that aren't found immediately.
* Helps avoid errors in cases where actors may not be loaded yet.

**WaitFor Actor Timeout**

_Time in seconds to wait for actors before timing out._

* Affects how long the node waits for missing actors.
* Set to 0.001 to 30 seconds.

**Wait For Missing Components**

_If enabled, wait for at least one PCG component to be found._

* Useful when you expect components to appear later in the frame.
* Use carefully to avoid infinite waits.

**WaitFor Component Timeout**

_Time in seconds to wait for components before timing out._

* Affects how long the node waits for missing components.
* Set to 0.001 to 30 seconds.

**Grab GenerateOnLoad**

_How to handle components with 'GenerateOnLoad' trigger._

* **Ignore**: Skip these components.
* **As-is**: Use data as-is without triggering generation.
* **Generate**: Trigger generation if needed, but don't force it.
* **ForceGenerate**: Force regeneration of already generated components.

**Grab GenerateOnDemand**

_How to handle components with 'GenerateOnDemand' trigger._

* Same options as GenerateOnLoad.

**Grab GenerateAtRuntime**

_How to handle components with 'GenerateAtRuntime' trigger._

* **Ignore**: Skip these components.
* **As-is**: Use data as-is without triggering refresh.
* **Refresh**: Refresh and wait for completion.

#### Output

Controls how the output data is structured and tagged.

**Dedupe Data**

_If enabled, only output component data once per unique actor._

* Prevents duplicate outputs when multiple components are found per actor.
* When enabled, TargetIndexToTag is disabled.

**Carry Over Target Tags**

_If enabled, target collections' tags will be added to the output data._

* Adds tags from the PCG components to the output points.

**Target Attributes To Data Tags**

_Lets you tag output data with attribute values from target points input._

* Maps point attributes to tags on the output data.
* Useful for associating metadata with generated content.

**Output Roaming**

_If enabled, adds an extra pin that contains all the data that isn't part of the template._

* Allows access to additional data not directly tied to the main graph.

**Roaming Pin**

_Name of the roaming data output pin._

* Defines the name of the optional roaming data pin.

***

#### Warnings and Errors

Controls how warnings and errors are handled during execution.

**Quiet Actor Not Found Warning**

_When enabled, suppresses warnings about missing actors._

* Useful to reduce noise in cases where missing actors are expected.

**Quiet Component Not Found Warning**

_When enabled, suppresses warnings about missing components._

* Reduces log clutter when components may not exist yet.

**Quiet Timeout Error**

_When enabled, suppresses timeout-related errors._

* Prevents error messages when timeouts occur during searches.
