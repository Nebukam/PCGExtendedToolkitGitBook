> Rotate a point or transform to closely match an input direction (or look at location) but preserve orthogonality.

### Overview

This node rotates points so they align as closely as possible with a specified direction or target location, while maintaining their orthogonal structure (i.e., preserving the relationship between X, Y, and Z axes). It's useful for orienting objects to face a particular direction or target, such as making trees grow toward a wind direction, or having buildings face a specific point in space.

The node supports multiple modes of operation:

* **Direction**: Align with a fixed vector.
* **Look at Position (World)**: Orient toward a world-space location.
* **Look at Position (Relative)**: Orient toward a relative position.
*   **Look at Closest Target**: Orient toward the closest point from a set of targets.

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p>This node preserves orthogonality, meaning it will rotate points to align with the target direction while maintaining the integrity of their local coordinate system. This is especially useful for ensuring that objects like trees or buildings maintain their structural orientation during procedural placement.</p></div>

### Properties Overview

Controls how the node aligns points and what data it uses for orientation.

***

#### Alignment Mode

Controls the method by which the node determines the target direction or position to match.

**Mode**

_The alignment mode to use._

* Determines whether the node rotates based on a fixed vector, a world position, a relative position, or the closest point from a set of targets.
* **Direction**: Align with a constant or attribute-defined vector.
* **Look at Position (World)**: Orient toward a world-space location.
* **Look at Position (Relative)**: Orient toward a relative position.
* **Look at Closest Target**: Orient toward the closest point in the target input.

***

#### Match Input

Controls how the direction or target is defined for alignment.

**Match Input**

_Whether to use a constant value or an attribute from the input points._

* When set to **Attribute**, the node reads the match vector from a specified attribute on each point.
* When set to **Constant**, it uses the fixed value provided in the **Match** setting.

**Match Source**

_The attribute to read the match vector from when using Attribute mode._

* This is only shown when **Match Input** is set to **Attribute**.

**Match Constant**

_The constant vector used for alignment when using Constant mode._

* This is only shown when **Match Input** is set to **Constant**.

***

#### Target Matching

Controls how the node handles target points when using "Look at Closest Target" mode.

**Data Matching**

_Whether to filter which targets are considered for matching._

* When enabled, you can define rules to match specific data to specific targets.
* Only applicable in **Look at Closest Target** mode.

**Distance Details**

_Distance method used to find the closest target point._

* Defines how distance is calculated between source and target points.
* Only shown when using **Look at Closest Target** mode.

### Notes

* This node works best with points that have a defined orientation or transform, such as those generated by other PCG nodes like "Transform Points" or "Place Objects".
* When using **Look at Closest Target**, ensure the target input contains enough points to provide meaningful matches.
* For performance reasons, consider disabling **Bulk Init Data** if you're working with large datasets and don't require parallel processing benefits.
