# Best Match Axis

Rotate a point or transform to closely match an input direction (or look at location) but preserve orthogonality.

### Overview

This node adjusts point rotations so that one axis aligns as closely as possible with a target direction, while keeping the other axes perpendicular. Unlike a full "look at" rotation, this preserves the orthogonal relationship between axes, which is essential when you need aligned transforms without arbitrary roll or when matching orientations to surfaces or vectors.

### How It Works

1. **Target Resolution**: Determines the target direction based on mode (constant/attribute vector, world position, relative position, or closest target point)
2. **Direction Calculation**: For position-based modes, computes the look-at direction from each point toward the target
3. **Axis Matching**: Rotates the point's transform so that its best-matching axis aligns with the target direction
4. **Orthogonality Preservation**: Adjusts the rotation to maintain perpendicular relationships between all axes

**Usage Notes**

* **Orthogonal Constraint**: Unlike a free-form look-at, this node ensures axes remain perpendicular - useful for maintaining consistent orientations on grids or structured layouts
* **Closest Target Mode**: When using ClosestTarget mode, connect target points to the Labels input pin
* **Axis Selection**: The node automatically determines which axis best matches the target direction

### Behavior

#### Best Match Axis modes:

**Direction Mode:**

```
Target direction: ↗
                ↗
Point rotates to align best axis with direction
while keeping other axes orthogonal
```

**Look At (World Position):**

```
                            [Target Position]
                                ↑
[Point] ─────────────────────→ │

Computes direction from point to world position

Look At (Relative Position):
        [+Offset]
            ↑
[Point]──→│

Offset is relative to point's local space
```

**Closest Target:**

```
        [Target A]
            ↑
[Point]───→│    [Target B - farther]

Connects to nearest target from Labels input
```
