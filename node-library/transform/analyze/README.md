# Analyze

**Nodes that inspect spatial properties of point data.** Collocation Count finds how many points share the same position, Normalize rescales point positions into a unit range, Bounds Axis To Points extracts axis-aligned reference points from bounding boxes, and Find Point on Bounds locates the closest point on a bounding volume. Read-only inspection — none of these modify the input points.
