# Discard by Point Count

While not 100% accurate, it should properly capture what the node/factory does. It stills needs to be proofread by a human.

> Filter outputs by point count.

### Overview

This node allows you to filter out clusters or point sets based on how many points they contain. You can specify a minimum and/or maximum number of points, and any input that falls outside those bounds will be discarded from the output.

This is useful when you want to clean up data that's too sparse (fewer than a threshold) or too dense (more than a threshold), such as removing small clusters from a point cloud or filtering out overly large groups in a mesh generation pipeline.

{% hint style="info" %}
The node works on point sets, which are typically generated by nodes like **Cluster Points** or **Group Points**.

<details>

<summary>Inputs</summary>

* **Main Input (Default)**: Accepts point data such as clusters or groups of points.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Outputs</summary>

* **Main Output (Default)**: Point data that passes the point count filter.
* Additional outputs may be created based on the settings, depending on whether items are discarded or not.

</details>

### Properties Overview

Controls how the node filters point sets by their size.

***

#### Filtering Settings

Define the minimum and maximum number of points allowed in an output.

**Remove Below**

_When enabled, any input with fewer points than the specified minimum will be discarded._

* Affects which outputs are passed through to the main output pin
* Useful for filtering out very small clusters or noise

**Values**:

* **Disabled**: No filtering based on minimum point count
* **Enabled**: Filter out inputs with fewer points than Min Point Count

**Min Point Count**

_Minimum number of points required for an input to be kept._

* How many points must exist in a cluster to pass the filter
* Set to 0 to allow empty clusters (if bAllowEmptyOutputs is enabled)
* For example, setting this to 5 will discard any cluster with fewer than 5 points

**Remove Above**

_When enabled, any input with more points than the specified maximum will be discarded._

* Affects which outputs are passed through to the main output pin
* Useful for limiting the size of clusters or preventing overly large groups

**Values**:

* **Disabled**: No filtering based on maximum point count
* **Enabled**: Filter out inputs with more points than Max Point Count

**Max Point Count**

_Maximum number of points allowed for an input to be kept._

* How many points can exist in a cluster to pass the filter
* For example, setting this to 100 will discard any cluster with more than 100 points

**Allow Empty Outputs**

_When enabled, outputs that have been filtered down to zero points are still passed through._

* Useful when you want to preserve empty results in your graph for downstream logic
* When disabled, completely empty outputs are discarded from the pipeline

### Notes

* This node is commonly used after **Cluster Points** or similar clustering operations to clean up small or large clusters.
* You can combine multiple instances of this node to apply different filters sequentially.
* If both Remove Below and Remove Above are enabled, only point sets with a count between Min Point Count and Max Point Count (inclusive) will be passed through.
* Performance tip: If you're working with large datasets and don't need to keep empty outputs, disabling **Allow Empty Outputs** can reduce unnecessary processing.
