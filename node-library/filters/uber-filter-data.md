# Uber Filter (Data)

Filters entire point collections based on how many points pass filter conditions.

### Overview

This node evaluates filter conditions against points within each collection and keeps or discards entire collections based on how many points pass. Unlike point-level filtering, this operates at the collection level with three modes: All (all points must pass), Any (at least one point must pass), or Partial (a threshold number/percentage must pass). Collections that meet the criteria are kept, while those that don't are optionally discarded.

### How It Works

1. **Filter Loading**: Loads filter factory configurations from the Filters input pin
2. **Per-Collection Evaluation**: For each collection, tests all points against filters
3. **Pass Count**: Counts how many points passed the filter conditions
4. **Threshold Testing**: Compares pass count against mode requirements
5. **Collection Classification**: Determines if collection passes or fails as a whole
6. **Output Routing**: Routes passing collections to Inside, failing to Outside

### Behavior

**All Mode (All points must pass):**

```
Collection A (10 points):
  8 points pass filter → FAIL (not all 10)
  → Routed to Outside

Collection B (5 points):
  5 points pass filter → PASS (all 5)
  → Routed to Inside
```

**Any Mode (At least one point must pass):**

```
Collection A (10 points):
  0 points pass filter → FAIL (none passed)
  → Routed to Outside

Collection B (10 points):
  1 point passes filter → PASS (at least one)
  → Routed to Inside

Collection C (10 points):
  7 points pass filter → PASS (at least one)
  → Routed to Inside
```

**Partial Mode - Relative (Percentage):**

```
Measure: Relative
Comparison: >= (Equal Or Greater)
DblThreshold: 0.5 (50%)

Collection A (10 points):
  4 points pass → 40% → FAIL (< 50%)
  → Routed to Outside

Collection B (10 points):
  5 points pass → 50% → PASS (>= 50%)
  → Routed to Inside

Collection C (10 points):
  7 points pass → 70% → PASS (>= 50%)
  → Routed to Inside
```

**Partial Mode - Discrete (Count):**

```
Measure: Discrete
Comparison: >= (Equal Or Greater)
IntThreshold: 5

Collection A (10 points):
  3 points pass → FAIL (3 < 5)
  → Routed to Outside

Collection B (10 points):
  5 points pass → PASS (5 >= 5)
  → Routed to Inside

Collection C (20 points):
  8 points pass → PASS (8 >= 5)
  → Routed to Inside
```

**Comparison Operators (Partial Mode):**

```
Threshold: 50% (0.5)

Collection with 60% pass rate:

Comparison = >= : PASS (60% >= 50%)
Comparison = > : PASS (60% > 50%)
Comparison = == : FAIL (60% != 50%)
Comparison = < : FAIL (60% not < 50%)
Comparison = <= : FAIL (60% not <= 50%)
```

**Swap (Invert Results):**

```
Mode: Any
bSwap: true

Collection A: 5 points pass
  Normal: PASS → Inside
  Swapped: FAIL → Outside

Collection B: 0 points pass
  Normal: FAIL → Outside
  Swapped: PASS → Inside
```

**Nearly Equal Comparison:**

```
Measure: Relative
Comparison: ~= (Nearly Equal)
DblThreshold: 0.5
Tolerance: 0.05

Collection A: 48% pass → Within tolerance (|0.48-0.5|=0.02 < 0.05) → PASS
Collection B: 45% pass → Outside tolerance (|0.45-0.5|=0.05 = 0.05) → PASS
Collection C: 44% pass → Outside tolerance (|0.44-0.5|=0.06 > 0.05) → FAIL
```

Good for: collection-level filtering, quality thresholds, batch validation, data completeness checks

### Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Mode</strong> <code>EPCGExUberFilterCollectionsMode</code></summary>

Determines how many points must pass for a collection to be kept.

| Mode              | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **All** (default) | All points in the collection must pass filters    |
| **Any**           | At least one point must pass filters              |
| **Partial**       | A threshold number/percentage of points must pass |

**All**: Strictest - requires 100% pass rate **Any**: Most lenient - requires at least 1 passing point **Partial**: Configurable threshold for pass rate

Default: `All`

### Practical Examples

**Quality Control:**

```
Mode: All
Purpose: Keep only collections where all points are valid
Use: Ensure 100% data quality before processing
```

**Presence Detection:**

```
Mode: Any
Purpose: Keep collections with at least one matching point
Use: Find collections containing specific features
```

**Majority Vote:**

```
Mode: Partial, Measure: Relative, Threshold: 0.5
Purpose: Keep collections where majority pass
Use: Democratic selection based on point properties
```

**Minimum Count:**

```
Mode: Partial, Measure: Discrete, Threshold: 50
Purpose: Keep collections with at least 50 passing points
Use: Ensure sufficient data density
```

### Filter Factories

The node accepts filter factory inputs that define point-level filtering logic:

**Available Filter Types:**

* **Attribute Filters**: Test point attributes
* **Bounds Filters**: Test spatial properties
* **Tag Filters**: Match tags
* **Custom Filters**: User-defined conditions

Multiple filters can be connected and are combined based on their factory settings.
