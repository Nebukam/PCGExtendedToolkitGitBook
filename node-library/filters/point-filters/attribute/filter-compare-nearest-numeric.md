# Filter : Compare Nearest (Numeric)

Compares a numeric attribute value read from the nearest target point.

### Overview

This filter evaluates points by finding the nearest target point and reading a numeric attribute from it, then comparing that value against a threshold. Unlike the standard numeric compare filter which reads both operands from the same point, this filter reads Operand A from the closest target point based on distance. This enables proximity-based attribute comparisons across separate point collections.

> This is a [filter-definition](../../common-settings/filter-definition/ "mention")

### How It Works

1. **Target Resolution**: Finds the nearest target point for each input point using the configured distance method.
2. **Value Reading**: Reads Operand A from the nearest target point's attribute.
3. **Comparison**: Compares the target's value against Operand B using the selected operator.
4. **Result**: Returns pass if the comparison succeeds, fail otherwise.

**Usage Notes**

* **Targets Input**: Requires a "Targets" input pin providing the reference point collection.
* **Cross-Collection**: Operand A is read from the target, Operand B from the source or a constant.
* **Self-Exclusion**: Can exclude a collection from being matched against itself.

### Behavior

**Nearest Comparison:**

```
Source Points:  [P1 at (0,0,0), P2 at (100,0,0)]
Target Points:  [T1 at (10,0,0) Score=80, T2 at (90,0,0) Score=40]
Operand A: $Score (from target)
Operand B: 50 (constant)
Comparison: >=

P1 → Nearest target: T1 (Score=80) → 80 >= 50: Pass
P2 → Nearest target: T2 (Score=40) → 40 >= 50: Fail
```
