# Filter : Time

Checks point positions against a path/spline/polygon closest alpha.

### Overview

This filter evaluates points by finding the closest position on connected path-like data (paths, splines, or polygons) and comparing the resulting normalized time value (alpha, ranging from 0 to 1 along the path) against a threshold. When multiple paths are connected, the filter can use the closest path or consolidate time values across all matching paths. This enables filtering based on where a point falls relative to the progression of a path.

> This is a [filter-definition](../../common-settings/filter-definition/ "mention")

### How It Works

1. **Path Preparation**: Samples the connected path/spline data into polygonal shapes at the specified fidelity.
2. **Closest Point**: For each point, finds the closest position on the path(s) and computes the normalized time (0 at the start, 1 at the end).
3. **Consolidation**: If multiple paths are connected and Pick is set to All, consolidates time values using min, max, or average.
4. **Comparison**: Compares the resulting time value against Operand B using the selected comparison operator.
5. **Result**: Returns pass if the comparison succeeds, fail otherwise.

**Usage Notes**

* **Time Value**: The time (alpha) is a 0-to-1 value representing how far along the path the closest point falls. 0 is the start, 1 is the end.
* **Multiple Paths**: With the Closest pick mode, only the nearest path is considered. With All, time values from all paths are consolidated before comparison.
* **Collection Evaluation**: When Check Against Data Bounds is enabled, the collection's bounding box center is used as a proxy point instead of testing each point individually.

### Behavior

**Time Comparison:**

```
Path: [Start ─────────────── End]
      0.0                     1.0

Comparison: >= 0.5

Point A (near start): time=0.2 → 0.2 >= 0.5: Fail
Point B (midway):     time=0.5 → 0.5 >= 0.5: Pass
Point C (near end):   time=0.8 → 0.8 >= 0.5: Pass
```

**Multiple Paths with Consolidation:**

```
Path 1: closest time = 0.3
Path 2: closest time = 0.7

Consolidation = Min:     0.3 → compared against threshold
Consolidation = Max:     0.7 → compared against threshold
Consolidation = Average: 0.5 → compared against threshold
```
