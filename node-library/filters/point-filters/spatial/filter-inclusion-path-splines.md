# Filter : Inclusion (Path/Splines)

Checks points inclusion against path-like data (paths, splines, polygons).

### Overview

This filter tests whether points are inside, outside, or on the boundary of shapes defined by path-like data. It supports splines, paths, and polygon data as boundary definitions. The filter projects both the test points and the boundary shapes onto a 2D plane for containment testing, with configurable tolerance for boundary detection. Multiple shapes can be tested together with options for handling overlapping regions.

> This is a [filter-definition](../../common-settings/filter-definition/ "mention")

### How It Works

1. **Shape Preparation**: Collects and samples path/spline data into polygonal boundaries.
2. **2D Projection**: Projects points and boundaries onto the configured plane.
3. **Containment Test**: Performs point-in-polygon tests for each point against all shapes.
4. **Result Aggregation**: Combines results across multiple shapes using the configured pick mode.

**Usage Notes**

* **Closed Loops**: For containment tests, shapes should typically be closed loops.
* **Projection**: All testing happens in 2D after projection; choose the projection plane carefully.
* **Tolerance**: Adjust tolerance based on the scale of your shapes and desired boundary sensitivity.

### Behavior

**Check Types:**

```
Shape: Closed polygon boundary

Point A (center):    IsInside → Pass, IsOutside → Fail
Point B (on edge):   IsOn → Pass, IsInside → Fail, IsOutside → Fail
Point C (outside):   IsOutside → Pass, IsInside → Fail

Combined checks:
IsInsideOrOn:  A=Pass, B=Pass, C=Fail
IsOutsideOrOn: A=Fail, B=Pass, C=Pass
```

**Multiple Shapes:**

```
Pick Mode: All
Shape 1: Point inside
Shape 2: Point outside
Result: Fail (must be inside ALL)

Pick Mode: Closest
Shape 1 (farther): Point inside
Shape 2 (closer):  Point outside
Result: Fail (uses closest shape only)
```
