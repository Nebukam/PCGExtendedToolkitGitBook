# Math

**Math filters apply numeric and logical operations that go beyond simple attribute comparison.** Where attribute filters ask "what value does this point have?", math filters ask "what does this value mean in context?"

Modulo arithmetic lets you select every Nth point or test divisibility patterns. Statistical filters compare a point's value against the collection mean. Dot product and angle filters evaluate directional relationships between vectors. Bitmask filters test individual bit flags for encoded state.

The section also includes segment geometry filters — length testing and cross-product checks — which evaluate the implicit line segment between consecutive points.
