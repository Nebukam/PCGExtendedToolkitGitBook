# Filter : Segment Cross

Checks whether segments between consecutive points cross path-like data.

### Overview

This filter evaluates points by testing whether the segment from each point to its neighbor intersects with path-like data (paths, splines, or polygons). Each point defines a segment to the next (or previous) point, and the filter checks if that segment crosses any of the provided boundaries. This is useful for detecting when a path crosses a boundary or enters a restricted zone.

> This is a [filter-definition](../../common-settings/filter-definition/ "mention")

### How It Works

1. **Segment Construction**: For each point, builds a segment to its next or previous neighbor.
2. **Path Preparation**: Samples the connected path/spline data into polygonal boundaries.
3. **Intersection Test**: Tests each segment for intersection with the boundaries.
4. **Result**: Returns pass if the segment crosses any boundary, fail otherwise.

**Usage Notes**

* **Direction**: Choose whether segments go from each point to the next or to the previous point.
* **Point Attribution**: The pass/fail result is assigned to the starting point of the segment.
* **Open/Closed Paths**: Works with both open paths and closed loops.

### Behavior

**Segment Cross Detection:**

```
Path Points: [P0, P1, P2, P3, P4]
Boundary: Spline cutting across the path

Direction: ToNext
P0→P1: No cross → P0: Fail
P1→P2: Crosses boundary → P1: Pass
P2→P3: No cross → P2: Fail
P3→P4: No cross → P3: Fail

Direction: ToPrev
P1→P0: No cross → P1: Fail
P2→P1: Crosses boundary → P2: Pass
```
