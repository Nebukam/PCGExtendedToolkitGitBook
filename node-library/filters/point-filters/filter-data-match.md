# Filter : Data Match

Tests input data against targets using match rules.

### Overview

Filter : Data Match evaluates each input data collection against a set of target collections using configurable match rules. It operates at the collection level — all points within a matching collection pass (or fail) together. Match rules are provided as sub-nodes and can be combined with All (every rule must pass) or Any (at least one rule must pass) logic. The result can be inverted.

### How It Works

1. **Load Targets**: Reads target data collections from the `Targets` input pin
2. **Initialize Match Rules**: Loads match rule factories from their input pins and builds a data matcher
3. **Evaluate Per Collection**: For each input collection, checks whether it matches any target collection according to the configured rules and mode
4. **Apply Result**: All points in a matching collection receive the same pass/fail result. Inversion flips the outcome.

**Usage Notes**

* **Collection-Level Filter**: This filter evaluates entire collections, not individual points. Every point in a collection gets the same result.
* **Match Rules Required**: Without match rule sub-nodes connected, the filter has no criteria to evaluate and will fall back to the missing data policy.
* **Not Cacheable**: Results depend on the target data provided at runtime, so this filter cannot be cached.

### Inputs

| Pin             | Type      | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Targets**     | Points    | Target data collections to match against (required) |
| **Match Rules** | Factories | Match rule sub-nodes defining the matching criteria |

### Settings

#### Node-Specific Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Mode</strong> <code>EPCGExMapMatchMode</code></summary>

How match rules are combined when evaluating.

| Option  | Description                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **All** | Every match rule must pass for the collection to match        |
| **Any** | At least one match rule must pass for the collection to match |

Default: `All`

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Invert</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Inverts the filter result. When enabled, collections that match the rules will fail the filter, and collections that don't match will pass.

Default: `false`

| **Filter** | Factory | The filter factory, to be connected to a consumer node's filter pin |
