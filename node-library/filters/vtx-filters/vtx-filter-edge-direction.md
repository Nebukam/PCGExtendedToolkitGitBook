# Vtx Filter : Edge Direction

Filters vertices by comparing the directions of their connected edges against a reference direction.

### Overview

This vertex filter evaluates each vertex by comparing the directions of its connected edges against a reference direction. The adjacency settings control how results from multiple edges are aggregated. This allows you to filter vertices based on whether their connections point in a particular direction — for example, finding vertices where edges point upward or vertices at the end of horizontal segments.

> This is a [filter-definition](../common-settings/filter-definition/ "mention")

### How It Works

1. **Reference Direction**: Gets the comparison direction from either a constant or a vertex attribute.
2. **Edge Direction Computation**: For each connected edge, computes its direction vector.
3. **Direction Comparison**: Compares each edge direction against the reference using dot product or hash comparison.
4. **Aggregation**: Applies adjacency settings to determine if the vertex passes based on how many edges matched.
5. **Result**: Returns pass/fail based on the aggregated comparison results.

**Usage Notes**

* **Direction Order**: Controls whether edge directions point from the vertex outward or toward the vertex.
* **Dot Comparison**: Uses angular similarity; good for approximate direction matching.
* **Hash Comparison**: Uses exact vector matching; faster but requires precise alignment.
* **Transform Direction**: Optionally transforms the reference direction by the vertex's local transform.

### Behavior

```
Direction Examples (Reference = Up Vector, Adjacency = Any):

Vertex with upward edge:
  ↑
  [V]──→  Has one upward edge → PASS

Vertex with all horizontal edges:
  ←──[V]──→  No upward edges → FAIL
```
