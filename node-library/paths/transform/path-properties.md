# Path : Properties

One-stop node to compute useful path infos.

### Overview

This node computes a comprehensive set of path metrics and writes them to attributes. It can output path-level data (length, area, centroid, winding, oriented bounding box) and per-point data (angles, distances, normals, directions). It also analyzes path inclusion relationships to identify outer, inner, and nested paths.

### How It Works

1. **Project to 2D**: Some metrics require 2D analysis, so paths are projected using the configured projection settings.
2. **Compute Path Metrics**: Calculate length, area, perimeter, centroid, winding direction, and bounding box.
3. **Analyze Inclusion**: Determine which paths contain other paths to compute inclusion depth.
4. **Compute Point Data**: For each point, calculate angles, distances, normals, and directions.
5. **Write Attributes**: Output computed values to the configured attribute names.
6. **Tag and Route**: Apply tags and route paths to inclusion-based output pins.

**Usage Notes**

* **@Data Attributes**: Path-level attributes use the `@Data.` prefix by default, storing them in the data domain rather than per-point.
* **Inclusion Analysis**: Outer paths contain no other paths. Inner paths are contained by at least one other. Inclusion depth indicates nesting level.
* **2D Projection**: Area, perimeter, and winding are computed on a 2D projection. Configure the projection plane to match your use case.
* **Compactness**: Measures how close the shape is to a circle (1.0 = perfect circle, lower = more irregular).
