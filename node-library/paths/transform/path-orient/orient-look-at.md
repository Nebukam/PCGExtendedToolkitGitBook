# Orient Look At

Orients points to look at a target point, direction, or position.

### Overview

This orientation method rotates points so their forward axis points toward a specified target. The target can be a neighboring path point, a direction vector from an attribute, or a world position from an attribute.

### How It Works

1. **Determine Target**: Based on the selected mode, get either a neighboring point position, a direction vector, or a world position.
2. **Compute Direction**: Calculate the direction from the current point to the target (or use the direction directly).
3. **Build Transform**: Construct the orientation with the look-at direction as the forward axis and the configured up axis.

**Usage Notes**

* **Path Neighbors**: Next Point and Previous Point modes use the path topology to find targets. At path endpoints, the available neighbor is used.
* **Attribute Modes**: Direction and Position modes read from point attributes, allowing per-point control over orientation targets.
* **Direction vs Position**: Direction mode uses the attribute value directly as a direction vector. Position mode computes the direction from the point's location to the attribute position.

### Behavior

```
Look At Modes:

Next Point:              Previous Point:
  Current ●────→ Next      Previous ←────● Current

Direction (attribute):   Position (attribute):
  Current ●────→ Dir         Current ●────→ Target Position
            (from attr)                    (world space)
```

#### Node-Specific Settings

<summary><strong>Look At</strong> <code>EPCGExOrientLookAtMode</code></summary>

Determines what the point should look at.

| Option             | Description                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Next Point**     | Look toward the next point in the path.                     |
| **Previous Point** | Look toward the previous point in the path.                 |
| **Direction**      | Use a vector attribute as the look direction (local space). |
| **Position**       | Use a vector attribute as a world position to look at.      |

Default: `NextPoint`
