# Path × Bounds Intersection

Find intersection with target input points.

### Overview

This node detects where paths intersect with the oriented bounding boxes (OBB) of target points and inserts new points at those intersection locations. The bounds respect each target point's rotation, making this useful for collision detection with arbitrarily oriented volumes.

Intersection points receive metadata about the cut (entry vs exit, surface normal, which bound was hit) and can inherit attributes from both the path's neighboring points and the intersected bound itself.

### How It Works

1. **Build OBBs**: Oriented bounding boxes are constructed from target points using their bounds, scale, and rotation.
2. **Test Intersections**: Each path segment is tested against relevant bounds for intersection.
3. **Insert Points**: New points are created at exact intersection locations along the path.
4. **Classify Cuts**: Each intersection is classified by type (entry, exit, or edge cases).
5. **Blend & Forward**: Intersection points receive blended attributes from path neighbors and optionally forwarded attributes from the bound.
6. **Tag Paths**: Paths are tagged based on whether they were cut.

### Cut Types

The `CutType` attribute classifies each intersection point:

| Value           | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entry**       | Path enters a bound (normal case - will have a matching Exit). |
| **Exit**        | Path exits a bound (normal case - has a matching Entry).       |
| **EntryNoExit** | Path enters a bound but ends inside (no exit intersection).    |
| **ExitNoEntry** | Path starts inside a bound and exits (no entry intersection).  |

These edge cases are important for handling paths that begin or end within bounds.

**Usage Notes**

* **Oriented Bounds**: Unlike axis-aligned tests, the bounds respect point rotation. A rotated box point creates a rotated intersection volume.
* **Data Matching**: Use data matching to control which target bounds are tested against which paths.
* **Attribute Forwarding**: Attributes from the intersected bound can be forwarded to intersection points, useful for transferring material IDs or zone identifiers.

### Behavior

```
Normal intersection (Entry + Exit):

    ●───────────●───────────●  Path
                 \         /
              ┌───●───────●───┐
              │  Entry   Exit │  Bound
              └───────────────┘

Path ends inside bound (EntryNoExit):

    ●───────────●───────●
                 \
              ┌───●──────┼──┐
              │  Entry   │  │  Path ends inside
              └──────────┼──┘
                         ●

Path starts inside bound (ExitNoEntry):

                ●───────●───────────●
                       /
              ┌──────●───┐
              │     Exit │  Path started inside
              └──────────┘
```
