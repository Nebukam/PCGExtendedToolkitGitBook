# Intersect

**Nodes that find where paths cross each other or clip against geometry.** Clipper2 Boolean applies set operations (union, intersection, difference) between closed paths. Rect Clip trims paths against an axis-aligned rectangle. Path x Path Crossings finds intersection points between arbitrary path pairs, and Path x Bounds Intersection clips paths against bounding volumes.

For background on path fundamentals, see [Paths](../../../working-with-pcgex/paths/).
