# Path × Path Crossings

Find crossing points between & inside paths.

### Overview

This node detects where path segments intersect with other path segments, either between different paths or within the same path (self-intersection). New points can be inserted at crossing locations with metadata about the intersection.

### How It Works

1. **Build Spatial Index**: Path segments are indexed for efficient intersection testing.
2. **Find Crossings**: Each segment is tested against potentially intersecting segments based on filtering rules.
3. **Insert Points**: New points are created at crossing locations along each affected path.
4. **Blend Attributes**: Crossing points receive blended attributes from the path's neighboring points and optionally from the crossing path.
5. **Tag Paths**: Paths are optionally tagged based on whether they have crossings.

**Usage Notes### Point Insertion Only**

This node inserts new points at crossing locations within the existing paths and optionally flags them. It does **not** merge paths or create branching structures. For merging paths at crossings or building connected networks, use Path to Cluster instead.

* **Self-Intersection**: When enabled, paths are tested against their own segments (useful for detecting where a path crosses over itself).
* **Cut/Cutter Tags**: Use tags to control which paths can be cut and which paths do the cutting. This allows asymmetric intersection behavior.
* **Angle Filtering**: Use min/max angle constraints to only detect crossings at certain angles (e.g., only perpendicular crossings).

### Behavior

```
Two paths crossing:

Path A:    ●───────●───────●
                    \
Path B:    ●─────────●─────────●
                      \
                       ●

After processing, new crossing point inserted on both paths:

Path A:    ●───────●───●───●
                       ↑
                    Crossing
Path B:    ●─────────●─●─────●
```

### Settings

#### Node-Specific Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Self Intersection Only</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Only test each path against itself, ignoring other paths. Useful for detecting where a single path crosses over itself.

Default: `false`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can Be Cut Tag</strong> <code>FName</code></summary>

Tag filter for paths that can be cut. Only paths with this tag (or without, if inverted) will receive crossing points.

Default: None (all paths can be cut)

📋 _Visible when Self Intersection Only = false_

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can Cut Tag</strong> <code>FName</code></summary>

Tag filter for paths that can cut others. Only paths with this tag (or without, if inverted) will be used as cutters.

Default: None (all paths can cut)

📋 _Visible when Self Intersection Only = false_

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Create Point At Crossings</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Insert new points at crossing locations. When disabled, only metadata and tags are applied without modifying point counts.

<summary><strong>Blending</strong> <code>UPCGExSubPointsBlendInstancedFactory</code></summary>

How crossing point attributes are blended from neighboring path points.

| Option            | Description                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Inherit Start** | Inherit from segment's start point. |
| **Inherit End**   | Inherit from segment's end point.   |
