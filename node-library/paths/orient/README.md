> Orient path points along their direction, adjusting their rotation to match the path's flow.

### Overview

This node adjusts the orientation of points along a path so they align with the path's direction. It's useful for creating objects like roads, rivers, or trails that follow a specific route and need to be rotated accordingly. You can either apply the new orientation directly to each point or output it as an attribute for further use.

{% hint style="info" %}
This node works on paths generated by other nodes such as "Path : Generate" or "Path : From Points". It modifies the rotation of points along those paths.

### Properties Overview

Controls how the path points are oriented and whether the result is applied directly or output as an attribute.

***

#### Settings

Controls the core orientation behavior.

**Orient Axis**

_The axis of the point that should align with the path direction._

* Determines which direction of the point will face along the path
* For example, setting this to **Forward** makes the front of the point point in the direction of the path

**Values**:

* **Forward**: Forward (X+)
* **Backward**: Backward (X-)
* **Right**: Right (Y+)
* **Left**: Left (Y-)
* **Up**: Up (Z+)
* **Down**: Down (Z-)

**Up Axis**

_The axis of the point that should align with the world's up direction._

* Controls how the point is oriented vertically
* For example, setting this to **Up** makes the top of the point point upward

**Values**:

* **Forward**: Forward (X+)
* **Backward**: Backward (X-)
* **Right**: Right (Y+)
* **Left**: Left (Y-)
* **Up**: Up (Z+)
* **Down**: Down (Z-)

**Orientation Factory**

_The orientation settings to use for the points._

* Allows you to define a custom orientation factory with specific axis settings
* If left blank, uses the global settings from this node

**Flip Direction**

_When enabled, reverses the orientation direction for all points._

* Useful for reversing the path direction without changing the path itself
* Can be overridden per-point using filters

**Output**

_How to apply or output the computed orientation._

* When set to **Apply to point**, the orientation is directly applied to each point's transform
* When set to **Output to attribute**, the orientation is stored in an attribute for later use

**Values**:

* **Apply to point**: Applies the orientation transform to the point
* **Output to attribute**: Output the orientation transform to an attribute

**Output Attribute**

_The name of the attribute where the orientation will be stored._

* Only used when "Output" is set to **Output to attribute**
* Defaults to **Orient**

**Output Dot**

_When enabled, computes and outputs the dot product between consecutive points._

* Useful for detecting sharp turns or changes in path direction
* Helps with visual effects or procedural adjustments

**Dot Attribute**

_The name of the attribute where the dot product will be stored._

* Only used when "Output Dot" is enabled
* Defaults to **Dot**

***

#### Filters

Optional filters to control which points get flipped.

**Flip Conditions**

_Filters that determine whether a point's orientation should be flipped._

* Points matching these filters will have their orientation reversed
* Useful for creating exceptions in path alignment (e.g., flipping certain segments)
