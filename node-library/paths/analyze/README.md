# Analyze

**Nodes that extract computed properties from paths without changing them.** Path Properties writes per-point metadata like segment length, direction, and curvature. Write Tangents computes and stores tangent vectors for downstream smoothing or spline output.

For background on how paths work and what properties are available, see [Paths](../../../working-with-pcgex/paths/).
