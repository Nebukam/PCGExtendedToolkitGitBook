# Paths

**Path operations — generating, transforming, modifying, and outputting ordered point sequences.** Paths in PCGEx are just points with an assumed order. These nodes work with that assumption to provide spline-like operations on point data.

### Sections

| Section   | Contents                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Generate  | Create paths — from clusters, from splines, shape-based generation |
| Transform | Modify path shape — smooth, resample, reverse, offset              |
| Modify    | Change path data — fuse, split, subdivide, blend attributes        |
| Output    | Convert path data — to splines, to meshes, extrusion               |

### Concepts
