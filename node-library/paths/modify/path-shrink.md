# Path : Shrink

Shrink path from its beginning and end.

### Overview

This node removes points from the start and/or end of paths, effectively shortening them. You can shrink by a fixed distance or by a point count, with options for how to handle the cut point when shrinking by distance.

### How It Works

1. **Select Endpoints**: Determine which ends of the path to shrink (start, end, or both).
2. **Calculate Shrink Amount**: Based on mode, determine how many points or how much distance to remove.
3. **Apply Stop Conditions**: Optionally stop shrinking early if points pass certain filters.
4. **Perform Cut**: Remove points and optionally create new endpoints at the exact cut location.
5. **Preserve Metadata**: Optionally keep original endpoint attributes on the new endpoints.

**Usage Notes**

* **Distance vs Count**: Distance mode is more precise for controlling exact path length. Count mode is simpler when you know how many points to remove.
* **Cut Types**: When shrinking by distance, "New Point" creates an interpolated point at the exact cut location. Other options snap to existing points.
* **Stop Conditions**: Use filters to prevent shrinking past important points (e.g., stop when reaching a tagged point).
* **Closed Loops**: This node is designed for open paths. A warning is shown when used on closed loops (which can be suppressed).

### Behavior

**Shrink by distance from both ends:**

```
Before:     ●───●───●───●───●───●───●
            ├──100──┤       ├──100──┤
            (shrink)         (shrink)

After:          ⊕───●───●───⊕
                ↑            ↑
           (new point)  (new point)
```

**Shrink by count (2 points from start):**

```
Before:     ●───●───●───●───●───●───●
            0   1   2   3   4   5   6

After:              ●───●───●───●───●
                    2   3   4   5   6
```

#### Advanced Settings

<details>

<summary><strong>Endpoints Ignore Stop Conditions</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, the path's original endpoint points themselves won't trigger stop conditions. This allows shrinking to start even if the first point would normally match a stop condition filter.

Default: `false`

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Preserve First Metadata</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When creating a new start point from shrinking, inherit attributes from the original first point instead of interpolating.

Default: `false`

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Preserve Last Metadata</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When creating a new end point from shrinking, inherit attributes from the original last point instead of interpolating.

Default: `false`

</details>

***

#### Warnings

<details>

<summary><strong>Quiet Closed Loop Warning</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Suppress the warning when attempting to shrink a closed loop path. Shrinking closed loops may produce unexpected results.

Default: `false`

#### Inherited Settings
