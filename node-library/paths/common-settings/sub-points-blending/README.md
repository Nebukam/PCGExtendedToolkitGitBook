# Sub-Points Blending

**Controls how attributes are assigned to newly created points when a path operation inserts points between existing ones.** Subdivision, resampling, and similar operations produce points that didn't exist in the original path. These blending modes decide whether new points inherit from the nearest neighbor, interpolate between neighbors, or receive no blending at all.
