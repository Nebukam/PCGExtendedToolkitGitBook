# Bitmask Merge

A Simple bitmask merge node.

**How It Works**

> AI-Generated, needs proofreading

* The Bitmask Merge node combines two input bitmasks using the specified bitwise operation defined by PCGExBitOp.
* It processes each corresponding pair of bits from the two inputs according to the selected bitwise operation (e.g., AND, OR, XOR).
* Outputs a new bitmask that represents the result of applying the chosen bitwise operation across all pairs of input bits.
