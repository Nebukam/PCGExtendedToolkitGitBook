# Write GUID

{% hint style="danger" %}
This documentation has been AI-generated from the source code and may not be 100% accurate.
{% endhint %}

> Writes a unique Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) on each point.

### Overview

This node generates a unique identifier for each point in your dataset, which can be used to track or reference specific points throughout your procedural workflow. It's particularly useful when you need to maintain consistent identification across multiple operations or when integrating with external systems that require unique identifiers.

The GUIDs are generated using Unreal Engine's built-in GUID system and can be formatted in various ways for compatibility with different use cases. You can control how uniqueness is determined by combining different point properties, such as index, position, seed, or grid information.

{% hint style="info" %}
GUIDs generated by this node are unique within the context of your PCG graph execution. If you need persistent GUIDs across multiple runs, consider storing them in attributes and using a persistence mechanism.

<summary>Inputs</summary>

* **Main Input**: Points to write GUIDs on.

<summary>Outputs</summary>

* **Main Output**: Points with the new GUID attribute added.

### Properties Overview

Controls how GUIDs are generated and stored on your points.

***

#### Settings

Configures the core behavior of GUID generation.

**Output Attribute Name**

_The name of the attribute to write the GUID to._

* This determines where the GUID is stored on each point
* Default is "GUID"
* Can be any valid attribute name

**Output Type**

_Whether to store the GUID as an integer or string._

* **Integer**: Stores a hash value of the GUID string (useful for fast comparisons)
* **String**: Stores the full formatted GUID string (useful for external system compatibility)

**Format**

_How the GUID should be formatted when stored as a string._

* **Digits**: 32 digits, e.g., `00000000000000000000000000000000`
* **Digits (Lowercase)**: 32 lowercase digits, e.g., `0123abc456def789abcd123ef4a5b6c7`
* **Digits (Hyphens)**: 32 digits separated by hyphens, e.g., `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
* **Digits (RFC 4122)**: 32 digits in lowercase with hyphens, e.g., `bd048ce3-358b-46c5-8cee-627c719418f8`
* **{Digits}**: Same as "Digits (Hyphens)" but enclosed in braces
* **(Digits)**: Same as "Digits (Hyphens)" but enclosed in parentheses
* **{Hex}**: Comma-separated hexadecimal values in braces
* **Unique Object GUID**: Format used by Unreal's FUniqueObjectGuid class
* **Short (Base64)**: Base64 encoded with dash and underscore replacements
* **Short (Base36)**: Base-36 encoded, case-insensitive for file systems

**Uniqueness**

_What components are used to ensure GUID uniqueness._

* **None**: No additional uniqueness markers (only point index)
* **Index**: Uses point index as a marker of uniqueness
* **Position**: Uses point position as a marker of uniqueness
* **Seed**: Uses point seed as a marker of uniqueness
* **Grid**: Uses PCG component Grid as a marker of uniqueness
* **All**: Combines all the above markers

**Unique Key Input**

_Whether to use a constant value or an attribute for GUID generation._

* **Constant**: Use a fixed integer value (default is 42)
* **Attribute**: Read the value from an input attribute

**Unique Key (Attribute)**

_The attribute to read the unique key from when "Unique Key Input" is set to "Attribute."_

* This attribute must contain integer values
* Used as part of the GUID generation process

**Unique Key (Constant)**

_The fixed integer value used for GUID generation when "Unique Key Input" is set to "Constant."_

* Default is 42
* Larger values may improve uniqueness across different runs

**Allow Interpolation**

_Whether the created attribute allows interpolation or not._

* When enabled, the GUID can be interpolated between points (not recommended for GUIDs)
* When disabled, the GUID remains constant per point

***

#### Hashes

Controls how position and grid data are used to calculate hash values.

**Grid Hash Collision**

_The collision tolerance for grid-based hashing._

* Affects how grid coordinates are rounded when calculating uniqueness
* Smaller values increase precision but may reduce uniqueness
* Default is 0.001

**Position Hash Collision**

_The collision tolerance for position-based hashing._

* Affects how point positions are rounded when calculating uniqueness
* Smaller values increase precision but may reduce uniqueness
* Default is 0.001

**Position Hash Offset**

_A fixed offset applied to all point positions before hashing._

* Useful for shifting the hash space to avoid collisions with other systems
* Default is (0, 0, 0)

### Notes

* GUIDs generated by this node are unique within a single execution of your PCG graph
* If you need persistent IDs across multiple runs, store the GUIDs in attributes and consider using a persistence mechanism
* The "Unique Key" value acts as a seed to ensure different GUIDs are generated for different instances of this node
* For performance-critical workflows, consider using integer output type instead of string for faster processing
* When using "Position" or "Grid" uniqueness flags, be aware that small changes in position or grid values can result in completely different GUIDs
* The "All" uniqueness flag combines index, position, seed, and grid information to maximize uniqueness
* For external system compatibility, use the "Digits (Hyphens)" or "Digits (RFC 4122)" formats
* When using "Short (Base64)" or "Short (Base36)" formats, be aware that these may not be globally unique but are useful for compact representations
