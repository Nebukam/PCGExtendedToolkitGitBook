# Analyze

**Nodes that inspect and summarize attribute data without changing it.** Attribute Hash computes per-point hashes for identity comparisons, Attribute Stats extracts min/max/average across a collection, and Reduce Data collapses entire collections into summary values. These are the read-only counterparts to the Generate and Modify sections.
