# Refresh Seed

Refresh point seed based on position.

**How It Works**

> AI-Generated, needs proofreading

* The Refresh Seed node updates the point seed using the position data provided as input.
* It uses a base seed value specified in the settings to initialize or influence the seed refreshing process.
* Positional information serves as a variable factor that modifies the base seed to produce a new, refreshed seed for each point.
