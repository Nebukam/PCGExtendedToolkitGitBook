# Generate

**Nodes that create new attribute values on points.** Write Index and Write GUID stamp identity attributes, Constant and Enum Constant write fixed values, Tuple packs multiple attributes into compound keys, and Pack Actor Data pulls properties from referenced actors into point attributes. Hoist Attributes promotes data-level metadata down to individual points. These are the building blocks for any downstream operation that needs attributes to exist before it can filter, sort, or match on them.
