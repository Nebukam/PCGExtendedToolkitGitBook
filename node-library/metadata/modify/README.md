**Nodes that transform existing attribute values.** Uber Blend applies blend operations across matched collections, Attribute Remap rescales values into new ranges, Refresh Seed regenerates per-point randomization, and Meta Cleanup strips unwanted attributes or resets internal state. BlendOp sub-nodes define the individual blending functions that Uber Blend consumes.
