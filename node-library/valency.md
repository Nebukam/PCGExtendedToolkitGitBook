# Valency

**Constraint solving and module assignment — WFC-style rule-based generation on cluster topology.** Valency assigns collection entries to Vtx based on connectivity constraints (orbitals, cages, bonding rules), then solves for valid configurations.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Valency is an advanced system that builds on clusters and asset staging. Familiarity with both is recommended before diving in.

### Concepts
