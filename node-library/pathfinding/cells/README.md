# Cells

**Cells are closed regions bounded by edges in a cluster.** The nodes here discover them — seeded from specific points, bounded by constraints, or exhaustively across the entire topology. Hulls are the outer boundary variant.

For the concepts behind cell discovery and how seeds, constraints, and growth interact, see [Cells and Hulls](../../../working-with-pcgex/pathfinding/cells-and-hulls.md).
