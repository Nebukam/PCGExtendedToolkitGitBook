# Find All Cells

Attempts to find the contours of all cluster cells.

### Overview

This node identifies all closed polygonal cells (faces) within a cluster graph by tracing the boundaries formed by edges. Each cell represents a closed region bounded by connected edges. The output includes path data for each cell's contour, with extensive filtering options based on size, area, compactness, and other geometric properties.

### How It Works

1. **Project to 2D**: Optionally projects the cluster to a 2D plane for consistent winding detection.
2. **Trace Cells**: For each edge, traces closed loops to identify cell boundaries.
3. **Apply Constraints**: Filters cells based on size, area, compactness, and other criteria.
4. **Expand Holes**: Optionally grows hole regions to exclude adjacent cells.
5. **Output Paths**: Builds path data for each valid cell contour.

**Usage Notes**

* **Winding Order**: Output paths can be forced to clockwise or counter-clockwise orientation.
* **Wrapping Bounds**: The outermost boundary that wraps the entire cluster can be excluded.
* **Holes Input**: Connect hole points to exclude cells containing those points.
* **Compactness**: Measures how circular a cell is (1.0 = perfect circle, lower = elongated).

### Behavior

```
Cell Detection:

Cluster Graph:
    [A]───[B]───[C]
     │ ╲ ╱ │ ╲ ╱ │
    [D]───[E]───[F]
     │ ╱ ╲ │ ╱ ╲ │
    [G]───[H]───[I]

Detected Cells (triangular regions):
   Cell 1: A → B → E → D → A
   Cell 2: B → C → F → E → B
   Cell 3: D → E → H → G → D
   Cell 4: E → F → I → H → E
   ... (and diagonal triangles)

Output: Collection of closed path contours
```
