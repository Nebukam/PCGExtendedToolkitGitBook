Heuristics based on node count.

**How It Works**

> AI-Generated, needs proofreading

* Computes heuristic values for nodes based on their count in the context of a graph or tree structure.
* Applies a filter configuration to determine which nodes are considered during the computation of the least node heuristic.
* Outputs the result that identifies or prioritizes paths with the fewest number of nodes according to the specified filter settings.
