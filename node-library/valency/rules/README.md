# Rules

**Sub-nodes that define bonding constraints and socket behavior for the valency system.** Bonding Rules control which orbital connections are allowed between cages, Socket Rules define how module sockets match and connect, and Orbital Sets group orbitals into named configurations. These feed into the valency staging pipeline as provider inputs.

For the concepts behind bonding, sockets, and orbitals, see [Valency](../../../working-with-pcgex/valency/).
