# Valency

**Valency is WFC-style constraint solving on cluster topology.** It assigns collection entries to Vtx based on connectivity constraints — orbitals, cages, bonding rules — then solves for valid configurations across the entire cluster. The system sits at the intersection of clusters and asset staging, using both as its foundation.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Valency is an advanced system that builds on clusters and asset staging. Familiarity with both is recommended before diving in.

Once a solve completes, utility nodes extract the results — writing socket transforms from solved module assignments or exposing orbital data as point attributes for downstream processing.
