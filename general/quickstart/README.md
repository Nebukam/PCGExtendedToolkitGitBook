# Quickstart

### 1. Install the plugin

You can get it from these two places:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Download from FAB</strong></td><td>Go to FAB and add the plugin to your account.</td><td><a href="https://www.fab.com/listings/3f0bea1c-7406-4441-951b-8b2ca155f624">https://www.fab.com/listings/3f0bea1c-7406-4441-951b-8b2ca155f624</a></td><td><a href="../../.gitbook/assets/FAB.jpg">FAB.jpg</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Build from Source</strong></td><td>Get the source code from GitHub.</td><td><a href="https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExtendedToolkit">https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExtendedToolkit</a></td><td><a href="../../.gitbook/assets/GIT.jpg">GIT.jpg</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% endcontent-ref %}

### 2. Make yourself comfortable with vanilla PCG.

**PCGEx introduces a lot of advanced manipulations and nodes, including concepts & patterns that are entirely foreign to vanilla PCG**. Make sure you get a firm grasp on the basic concepts behind Epic' PCG Framework first.

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Seriously, don't skip this step if you're completely new to PCG, or you will have a very frustrating experience.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Download the Example Project

PCGEx has an example project, that's a mix of feature showcase and more complex examples where multiple concepts work together. It can be [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExExampleProject).

{% content-ref url="example-project.md" %}
[example-project.md](example-project.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that for the example project to work, **you need either have installed the plugin through FAB, or manually add the plugin' source to the project** after download.
{% endhint %}

### 4. Check PCGEx Basics, maybe

You could try to go raw from there, because depending on how you best learn, the example project might be enough â€” however it's recommended to check the basics so you don't miss out on important details.

{% endcontent-ref %}



### 5. Profit!
