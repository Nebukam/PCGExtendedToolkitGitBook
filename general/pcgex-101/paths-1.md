# Workflow

Key takeaways:\
\- PCGEx different ecosystems all work hand-in-hand\
\- Clusters are mostly used to generate paths out of them\
\- Paths can be turned into more refined clusters\
\- Every other feature is leveraged one way or another at some point in the process\
\- There is ultimately no data segregation, everything you're manipulating is still just points in the end&#x20;
