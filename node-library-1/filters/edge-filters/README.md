# Edge Filters

**Filters that evaluate cluster edges. These access both the edge point and its endpoint Vtx data.**

| Node                                 | Description                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Edge Length**                      | Test edge distance                           |
| **Edge Endpoints Check**             | Test endpoint properties                     |
| **Edge Endpoints Compare (Numeric)** | Compare numeric attributes between endpoints |
| **Edge Endpoints Compare (String)**  | Compare string attributes between endpoints  |
| **Edge Neighbors Count**             | Test count of adjacent edges                 |
| **Edge Direction**                   | Classify edge direction against a reference  |
