# Vtx Filters

**Filters that evaluate cluster Vtx using topology information -- adjacency, neighbor relationships, edge properties.**

| Node                    | Description                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Node Adjacency**      | Test relationships between adjacent Vtx |
| **Node Edge Num**       | Test the number of connected neighbors  |
| **Node Edge Direction** | Test directions of connected edges      |
| **Node Edge Angle**     | Test angles between connected edges     |
