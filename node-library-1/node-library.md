# Node Library

**This is the reference section.** Every PCGEx node is documented here — inputs, outputs, settings, behavior. If you need to understand what a node does and how to configure it, this is where you look.

The library is organized by what you're working with, not by source module. Find the system you're using, then drill into the operation type.

### How to Navigate

If you're looking for a specific node, search by name. If you're exploring what's available, start with the section that matches your task:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Section</th><th>What's Here</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Filters</td><td>All filter types — point, edge, Vtx, collection, groups</td></tr><tr><td>Clusters</td><td>Cluster generation, refinement, transforms, analysis</td></tr><tr><td>Paths</td><td>Path generation, transforms, modification, output</td></tr><tr><td>Pathfinding</td><td>Algorithms, heuristics, goal pickers, cells</td></tr><tr><td>Staging</td><td>Asset collections, distribution, sockets</td></tr><tr><td>Sampling</td><td>Nearest queries, texture sampling, neighbor data</td></tr><tr><td>Shapes</td><td>Parametric shape generation</td></tr><tr><td>Tensors</td><td>Directional field effectors and sampling</td></tr><tr><td>Topology</td><td>Mesh generation from clusters and paths</td></tr><tr><td>Metadata</td><td>Attribute manipulation, bitmasks</td></tr><tr><td>Transform</td><td>Generic point transforms</td></tr><tr><td>Utilities</td><td>Noise, sorting, partitioning, data matching</td></tr><tr><td>Valency</td><td>Constraint solving and module assignment</td></tr><tr><td>Common Settings</td><td>Shared settings referenced across nodes</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Concepts vs Reference

This library documents **what nodes do**, not **why or when** to use them. For understanding workflows, mental models, and how systems fit together, see the Concepts section.

Each section links back to its corresponding concept pages where relevant.
