# Heuristics

## Heuristics

**Heuristic sub-nodes compute edge traversal costs for pathfinding algorithms. Multiple heuristics compose into blended scores.**

Standard heuristic types cover distance, attribute-based weights, and custom scoring.

Heuristics are also used by score-based edge refinement operations.
