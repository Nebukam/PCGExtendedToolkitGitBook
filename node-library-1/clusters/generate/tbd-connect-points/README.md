# TBD Connect Points

**Probe-based cluster generation. Connect Points creates edges between points using configurable probes.**

| Node / Section     | Description                                                               |

| **Connect Points** | Creates edges based on probe results. Multiple probes compose additively. |
| Probes             | All available probe types                                                 |

> See [Building Clusters](../../../../working-with-pcgex-1/clusters/building-clusters.md) for context on probe-based connectivity.
