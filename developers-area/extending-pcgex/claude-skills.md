# Claude Skills

I've been late on the hype train but started integrating Claude to my workflow as of early 2026. I've tried building up a few skills to help other Claude users get a headstart with the most "extension-friendly" bits of the codebase without having to burn a bazillion tokens.

> Some of those aren't as solid as I'd like but they will definitely help Claude get up and running on those specific topics.
