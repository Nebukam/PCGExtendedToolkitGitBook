## What is PCGEx?

The PCG Extended Toolkit (_PCGEx for short_) is an open source plugin that extends Unreal Engine’ Procedural Content Generation pipeline, with a focus on **building spatial relationships between points** and **path manipulation**.

It also comes with a lot of quality of life nodes, with support for a wide range of situations — even some very unique and niche things.

{% hint style="success" %}
PCGEx is available for Unreal **5.6, 5.5**, **5.4**, and **5.3**
{% endhint %}

## Highlights

How can PCGEx help you?

### Directed & Undirected graphs and diagrams

PCGEx introduces undirected graphs, allowing to create, manipulate & leverage connectivity between points. Find cells, contours, pathfinding and more.

### Edge-based pathfinding & modular heuristics

Leveraging diagrams & connected graphs, PCGEx enable highly customizable pathfinding using a modular and flexible heuristic ecosystem.

### Tensor Ecosystem

PCGEx comes with a tensor field ecosystem that seamlessly integrate with all other features. It lets you create complex spatial effectors to transform points, constrain heuristics, floodfill, or simply generate paths.

### Modular filters

PCGEx has a very large library of useful filters than can be combined to create infinitely complex conditions with branching and more — but more importantly, the plugin leverages filters as a powerful tool to create conditional behavior allowing tight control in intricate situations.

### Alternative, extended ways to sample & blend data

PCGEx has a variety of data samplers for points, splines, textures that streamline & consolidate common use-cases into much more straightforward setups.

### Paths Manipulation

PCGEx has a lot to offer when it comes to manipulating paths (think splines before they're splines), refining them, splitting them, cutting them, bevelling them, you name it.

### Quality of Life

Last but not least, there is a lot of QoL nodes designed to reduce the need & use of loop subgraphs as much as possible, extract information & statistics in new ways, manage & prepare data for spawning, creating graph dependency chains at runtime, ... At the time of writing, there's more than 200 nodes in the library.
