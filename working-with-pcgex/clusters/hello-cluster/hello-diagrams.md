# Hello Diagrams

The simplest, most straightforward way to get some edges going is using a [diagrams](../../../node-library/clusters/diagrams/ "mention") node:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Oh hai!

Without editing any of the basic settings, you should get something along the lines of this:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/placeholder-wide.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Depending on your needs, that can be a bit boring.\
