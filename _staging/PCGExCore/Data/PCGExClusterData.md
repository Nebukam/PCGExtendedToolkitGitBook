# Cluster Data

PCG data types representing cluster structures with nodes and edges.

## Overview

Cluster Data defines the PCG data type hierarchy for representing graph-like cluster structures in PCGEx. A cluster consists of two components: nodes (vertices) representing spatial points, and edges representing connections between nodes. These specialized data types extend PCG's point data system to carry relational information, enabling graph-based operations like pathfinding, connectivity analysis, and network processing.

## Data Type Hierarchy

```
UPCGExPointData (Base point data)
  └─ UPCGExClusterData (Abstract cluster base)
      ├─ UPCGExClusterNodesData (Cluster vertices/nodes)
      └─ UPCGExClusterEdgesData (Cluster edges/connections)
```

## Cluster Components

### Nodes (Vertices)

**Type**: `UPCGExClusterNodesData`
**Display Name**: "PCGEx | Cluster Vtx"

Represents the vertex/node component of a cluster. Each point in this data represents a node with spatial position and attributes. Nodes are the fundamental control points in the cluster graph.

**Characteristics**:
- Inherits full point data capabilities (position, rotation, scale, attributes)
- Can store per-node attributes (degree, connectivity, custom data)
- Serves as the spatial foundation for cluster operations
- Thread-safe cluster binding via read-write lock

### Edges (Connections)

**Type**: `UPCGExClusterEdgesData`
**Display Name**: "PCGEx | Cluster Edges"

Represents the edge/connection component of a cluster. Each point represents an edge connecting two nodes, storing connection information and edge-specific attributes.

**Characteristics**:
- Stores edge connectivity (which nodes are connected)
- Can carry edge attributes (weight, distance, type, custom data)
- Bound to the cluster structure via shared reference
- Enables relationship-based operations (pathfinding, traversal, filtering)

## How Clusters Work

#### Node-Edge Relationship:
```
Cluster Structure:

Nodes (UPCGExClusterNodesData):
  Node 0: Position (0, 0, 0)
  Node 1: Position (100, 0, 0)
  Node 2: Position (50, 100, 0)

Edges (UPCGExClusterEdgesData):
  Edge 0: Node 0 → Node 1
  Edge 1: Node 1 → Node 2
  Edge 2: Node 2 → Node 0

Forms a triangular graph structure.
```

#### Cluster Binding:
```
Edge data can be bound to a cluster structure:

Cluster = { Nodes, Edges, Connectivity Info }

Edge Data → SetBoundCluster(Cluster)
  → Edge operations can query node positions
  → Edge operations can traverse connections
  → Edge operations can access cluster topology
```

#### Data Flow:
```
Typical Cluster Pipeline:

1. Generate Nodes
   [Points] → [Node Data]

2. Generate Edges
   [Node Data] → [Build Cluster] → [Edge Data]

3. Process Cluster
   [Node Data + Edge Data] → [Cluster Operations]

4. Extract Results
   [Processed Cluster] → [Points/Paths/Attributes]
```

#### Usage Notes

- **Paired Data**: Nodes and edges are typically used together - edges reference nodes by index, so both datasets must be present and synchronized.
- **Cluster Binding**: Edge data maintains a bound cluster reference for efficient topology queries during operations.
- **Type Safety**: The specialized data types ensure cluster operations receive correctly structured data.
- **Thread Safety**: Node data uses read-write locks when accessing bound clusters for multi-threaded safety.
- **Spatial Queries**: While edges store connectivity, they can query bound cluster for node positions and spatial relationships.

## Data Type Information

### Base Cluster Part

**Struct**: `FPCGExDataTypeInfoClusterPart`
**Display Name**: "PCGEx | Cluster Part"

Base type information for all cluster components. Hidden in editor type selection (abstract base).

### Vertex Type

**Struct**: `FPCGExDataTypeInfoVtx`
**Display Name**: "PCGEx | Cluster Vtx"

Type information for cluster node/vertex data.

### Edge Type

**Struct**: `FPCGExDataTypeInfoEdges`
**Display Name**: "PCGEx | Cluster Edges"

Type information for cluster edge/connection data.

## Common Operations

**Building Clusters**:
- Create node data from points
- Generate edges based on proximity, Delaunay, MST, etc.
- Bind edges to cluster structure

**Processing Clusters**:
- Pathfinding using edges
- Connectivity analysis
- Node/edge filtering
- Attribute propagation along edges

**Extracting Results**:
- Convert clusters back to points
- Generate paths from edge traversal
- Export connectivity information
