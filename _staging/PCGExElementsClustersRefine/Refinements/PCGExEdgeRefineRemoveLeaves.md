# Remove Leaves

Removes leaf vertices (dead ends) and their connecting edges from the cluster.

## Overview

This edge refinement operation identifies and removes leaf nodes — vertices that have only one connection (dead ends). Both the leaf vertex and its single connecting edge are removed. This is useful for pruning terminal branches from a cluster while preserving the core connected structure.

## How It Works

1. **Leaf Detection**: Identifies vertices with exactly one connected edge (leaves).
2. **Validation**: Confirms the vertex is a true leaf and not part of a more complex structure.
3. **Removal**: Marks both the leaf vertex and its connecting edge as invalid.

#### Usage Notes

- **Single Pass**: This operation removes only the outermost layer of leaves. Vertices that become leaves after removal are not affected.
- **Use Recursive**: For complete branch removal, use Remove Leaves Recursive instead.
- **Preserves Structure**: Vertices with two or more connections are never removed.

## Behavior

```
Before:                         After:

    A
    |
    B---C---D                   B---C---D
        |                           |
        E---F                       E
            |
            G (leaf)

Leaves removed: A, G (and their edges)
F becomes a new leaf but is NOT removed in this pass.
```

## Settings

This refinement operation has no additional settings. It simply removes all current leaf vertices.
