# Apply Sampling Details

Configures how transform data from sampling operations is applied to the source points.

## Overview

This settings block controls how sampled transform information affects the points that performed the sampling. When sampling nearest surfaces, bounds, or other targets, this determines which components (position, rotation, scale) of the sampled transform are applied back to the source points, and on which axes. Each component can be selectively enabled per-axis.

## How It Works

1. **Sample Target**: A point samples a target (surface, bounds, etc.) and receives transform data
2. **Select Components**: Choose which transform components to apply (position, rotation, scale)
3. **Select Axes**: For each component, select which axes (X, Y, Z) to apply
4. **Modify Points**: Source points are updated with the selected sampled values

## Behavior

```
Sampling Application Example:

Sampled Transform:
  Position: (100, 50, 25)
  Rotation: (0, 45°, 0)
  Scale:    (2, 2, 2)

Original Point:
  Position: (0, 0, 0)
  Rotation: (0, 0, 0)
  Scale:    (1, 1, 1)

Settings: Apply Transform Position (Y, Z only)
Result:
  Position: (0, 50, 25)  ← X unchanged, Y and Z from sample
  Rotation: (0, 0, 0)    ← unchanged
  Scale:    (1, 1, 1)    ← unchanged
```
