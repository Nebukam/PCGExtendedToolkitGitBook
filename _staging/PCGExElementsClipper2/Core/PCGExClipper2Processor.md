# Clipper2 Processor (Base Class)

Base class providing common settings for all Clipper2-based path operations.

## Overview

This abstract base class provides shared configuration for nodes that use the Clipper2 library to perform 2D boolean operations (union, intersection, difference, XOR) and path offset/inflate operations. All Clipper2 nodes inherit these settings for precision control, path handling, attribute blending, and output configuration.

Clipper2 operates on 2D integer coordinates internally, so paths are projected onto a 2D plane, processed, then unprojected back to 3D space.

## Common Settings

### Processing Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Main Data Matching</strong> <code>FPCGExMatchingDetails</code></summary>

Controls how input data is grouped for processing. When enabled, paths with matching attributes or tags are grouped together for combined operations.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Mode** | enum | Matching mode (Disabled, Attribute, Tag, etc.) |
| **Cluster Match Mode** | enum | How cluster components match (Vtx, Edge) |
| **Split Unmatched** | bool | Output unmatched data separately |
| **Output Unmatched** | bool | Include unmatched data in output |
| **Limit Matches** | bool | Cap number of matches per group |
| **Limit** | int32 | Maximum matches when limiting |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Skip Open Paths</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, paths that are not closed loops are excluded from processing. Open paths cannot participate in boolean operations that require enclosed areas.

Default: `false`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

### Tweaks Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Precision</strong> <code>int32</code></summary>

Decimal precision multiplier for Clipper2's integer coordinate system. Clipper2 uses 64-bit integers internally for extreme precision. This value scales floating-point coordinates up before processing and back down afterward. Higher values preserve more decimal precision but may affect performance.

Default: `100`

Minimum: 1

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Simplify Paths</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, performs path simplification on the output to remove redundant points.

Default: `false`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Preserve Collinear</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, keeps collinear points in the output. When disabled, consecutive points that lie on the same line are merged, reducing point count.

Default: `true`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Arc Tolerance</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

Controls the accuracy of arc approximation when generating curved offsets (round joins/ends). Higher values produce fewer points but coarser curves. This value is scaled by the Precision setting internally.

Default: `5.0`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

### Output Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Carry Over Details</strong> <code>FPCGExCarryOverDetails</code></summary>

Controls which attributes and tags from input paths are transferred to output paths.

//→ See TODO FPCGExCarryOverDetails

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Blending Details</strong> <code>FPCGExBlendingDetails</code></summary>

Controls how point attributes are blended when paths are combined or new intersection points are created.

//→ See TODO FPCGExBlendingDetails

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Open Paths Output</strong> <code>EPCGExClipper2OpenPathOutput</code></summary>

Controls how open (non-closed) paths are handled in the output.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ignore** | Discard open paths from output |
| **Output** | Include open paths on the main output pin |
| **Output (Pin)** | Route open paths to a separate "Open Paths" pin |

Default: `Output`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Tag Holes</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, paths that represent holes (interior cutouts) are tagged with a specific tag.

Default: `false`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Hole Tag</strong> <code>FString</code></summary>

The tag applied to paths identified as holes.

Default: `Hole`

📋 *Visible when Tag Holes is enabled*

</details>

### Advanced Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Union Group Before Operation</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Debug option. When enabled, performs a union of all paths in the subject group before the main operation.

Default: `false`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Union Operands Before Operation</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Debug option. When enabled, performs a union of all paths in the operand group before the main operation.

Default: `false`

</details>

## Common Enums

### EPCGExClipper2JoinType

Controls the shape of corners when offsetting paths.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Square** | Right-angle corners |
| **Round** | Smooth curved corners |
| **Bevel** | Chamfered/cut corners |
| **Miter** | Extended pointed corners |

### EPCGExClipper2EndType

Controls how path endpoints are handled during offset operations.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Polygon** | Treat as closed polygon (ignores open/closed state) |
| **Joined** | Join endpoints creating a thin double-sided path |
| **Butt** | Flat perpendicular end caps |
| **Square** | Extended square end caps |
| **Round** | Smooth semicircular end caps |

### EPCGExClipper2FillRule

Determines how overlapping regions are treated during boolean operations.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Even Odd** | Alternating regions are filled/empty based on crossing count |
| **Non Zero** | Regions with non-zero winding number are filled |
| **Positive** | Only regions with positive winding are filled |
| **Negative** | Only regions with negative winding are filled |

## Inputs

| Pin | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **In** | Paths | Main input paths (subjects for boolean operations) |
| **Labels** | Params | Optional labels for data matching |

## Outputs

| Pin | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **Out** | Paths | Processed output paths |
| **Open Paths** | Paths | Open paths (when Output Pin mode is selected) |
