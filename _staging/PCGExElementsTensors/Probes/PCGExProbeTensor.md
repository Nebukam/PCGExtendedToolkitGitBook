# Probe : Tensor

Sample a tensor at point location and probe in that direction.

## Overview

The Tensor Probe samples the tensor field at each point's location and probes for connection candidates in that direction. This enables tensor-guided connectivity where points connect along flow lines, following the field rather than using fixed directions. Unlike the static Direction probe, the tensor direction can vary smoothly across space.

## How It Works

1. **Tensor Sampling**: At each point, samples the tensor field to get a direction vector.
2. **Angle Filtering**: Filters candidates to those within the configured angle threshold of the tensor direction.
3. **Candidate Scoring**: Scores candidates based on distance and/or dot product with the tensor direction.
4. **Connection Selection**: Selects the best candidate(s) based on the prioritization setting.

#### Usage Notes

- **Dynamic Directions**: Unlike Direction probe which uses a fixed or attribute-based direction, Tensor probe directions vary based on the field at each point's location.
- **Chained Processing**: When enabled, processes candidates sequentially, which can yield different results than parallel processing.
- **Component-Wise Angles**: Allows different tolerances for pitch, yaw, and roll instead of a single cone angle.

## Behavior

```
Tensor Field: Flowing right-to-left in a curve

Point A (tensor = →):     Probes right, finds B
Point B (tensor = ↗):     Probes up-right, finds C
Point C (tensor = ↑):     Probes up, finds D

Result: A──B──C──D follows the tensor flow
```

## Inputs

| Pin | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **Tensors** | Tensor Factories | Tensor field definitions for probe directions |

## Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Invert Tensor Direction</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, mirrors the direction sampled from tensors (*-1). Probes in the opposite direction of the tensor field.

Default: `false`

<details>
<summary><strong>Favor</strong> <code>EPCGExProbeDirectionPriorization</code></summary>

What to prioritize when selecting the best candidate.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dot** | Favor candidates most aligned with the tensor direction |
| **Distance** | Favor closest candidates within the angle range |

Default: `Dot`

<details>
<summary><strong>Use Component Wise Angle</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, uses separate angle thresholds for pitch, yaw, and roll instead of a single max angle cone.

Default: `false`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Max Angle</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

Maximum angle (in degrees) from the tensor direction within which to search for candidates.

Default: `45`

Range: `0` to `180`

📋 *Visible when Use Component Wise Angle is disabled*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Max Angles</strong> <code>FRotator</code></summary>

Maximum angles per component (Pitch, Yaw, Roll) within which to search for candidates.

Default: `(45, 45, 45)`

📋 *Visible when Use Component Wise Angle is enabled*

### Inherited Settings

This probe inherits from the probe factory base.

→ See [Probe Factory](../../PCGExElementsProbing/Core/PCGExProbeFactoryProvider.md) for common probe options including search radius and connection limits.

## Outputs
