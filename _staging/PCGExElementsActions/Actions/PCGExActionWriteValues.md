# Action : Write Attributes

Forward attributes based on match result.

## Overview

This action factory conditionally forwards attributes from input attribute sets to points based on filter match results. When a filter matches successfully, it forwards one set of attributes; when the filter fails, it forwards a different set. This allows conditional attribute writing within the Batch Actions workflow.

## How It Works

1. **Match Evaluation**: The parent filter determines whether each point matches
2. **Success Path**: On successful match, forwards attributes from the success attribute set
3. **Fail Path**: On failed match, forwards attributes from the fail attribute set
4. **Attribute Writing**: Writes the selected attributes to the corresponding points

#### Usage Notes

- **Batch Actions Integration**: This action is used within the Batch Actions node, not standalone
- **Attribute Sets**: Requires attribute set inputs containing the values to forward
- **Conditional Logic**: Enables different attribute values based on filter results
- **Attribute Filtering**: Both success and fail paths support attribute filtering patterns

## Inputs

When used in Batch Actions:

| Pin | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **MatchSuccess** | Attribute Set | Attributes to forward on successful filter match |
| **MatchFail** | Attribute Set | Attributes to forward on failed filter match |

## Settings

### Success Attributes

<details>
<summary><strong>Success Attributes Filter</strong> <code>FPCGExAttributeGatherDetails</code></summary>

Controls which attributes from the MatchSuccess input are forwarded to points when the filter matches. Supports include/exclude patterns and attribute name filtering.

Default: All attributes

//→ See TODO FPCGExAttributeGatherDetails

</details>

### Fail Attributes

<details>
<summary><strong>Fail Attributes Filter</strong> <code>FPCGExAttributeGatherDetails</code></summary>

Controls which attributes from the MatchFail input are forwarded to points when the filter fails. Supports include/exclude patterns and attribute name filtering.

Default: All attributes

//→ See TODO FPCGExAttributeGatherDetails
