# Sample : Overlap Stats

Sample and write per-point overlap stats between entire point data.

## Overview

This node analyzes overlap between points across multiple collections and writes overlap statistics to individual points. Unlike Discard By Overlap which operates on entire datasets, this node computes overlap metrics for each point, allowing fine-grained overlap-based filtering or weighting in downstream operations.

## How It Works

1. **Build Octrees**: Creates spatial indices for all point bounds.
2. **Detect Overlaps**: Tests bounds intersection between collections.
3. **Count Per Point**: Tracks how many other collections overlap each point.
4. **Write Stats**: Outputs overlap counts and relative metrics to attributes.

#### Usage Notes

- **Per-Point Stats**: Each point gets its own overlap count, not collection-wide.
- **Overlap Count**: Number of different collections that overlap this point.
- **Sub Count**: Total number of points from other collections that overlap.
- **Relative Values**: Counts relative to the maximum across all collections.

## Behavior

#### Overlap Statistics:
```
Collections A, B, C with overlapping regions:

Point P1 in Collection A:
   Overlaps with: 2 points from B, 1 point from C
   → OverlapCount = 2 (B and C)
   → OverlapSubCount = 3 (total overlapping points)

Point P2 in Collection A:
   Overlaps with: 0 points
   → OverlapCount = 0
   → OverlapSubCount = 0
```
