# Sort Collections

Sort collection using @Data domain attributes.

## Overview

This node reorders entire collections within the output based on their @Data domain attribute values. Unlike Sort Points which reorders points within collections, this node changes the order of collections themselves. Connected sorting rules determine which @Data attributes to compare and in what priority order.

## How It Works

1. **Gather Rules**: Collects sorting rules from connected sub-nodes, ordered by priority.
2. **Read @Data**: For each collection, reads the specified @Data domain attribute values.
3. **Compare Collections**: Evaluates rules in order to determine collection ordering.
4. **Reorder Output**: Outputs collections in the sorted order.

#### Usage Notes

- **@Data Domain**: This node compares collection-level metadata, not individual point attributes.
- **Same Rules**: Uses the same Sorting Rule sub-nodes as Sort Points.
- **Stable Sort**: Collections with equal values maintain their relative input order.

## Behavior

```
Collection Sorting:

Input Collections:
   Collection A: @Data.Priority = 3
   Collection B: @Data.Priority = 1
   Collection C: @Data.Priority = 2

Direction = Ascending:
   Output: B, C, A (1, 2, 3)

Direction = Descending:
   Output: A, C, B (3, 2, 1)
```

## Inputs

| Pin | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **In** | Any | Input data collections to sort |
| **SortRules** | Params | Sorting Rule sub-nodes defining sort criteria |
