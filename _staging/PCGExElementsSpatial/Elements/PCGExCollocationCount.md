# Collocation Count

Write the number of times a point shares its location with another.

## Overview

Collocation Count identifies points that occupy the same position (within a tolerance) and writes count metadata to each point. For each point, it records how many other points share its location, and optionally assigns a linear occurrence index to distinguish between collocated points.

## How It Works

1. **Spatial Query**: Builds an octree from the input points for efficient spatial lookups.
2. **Collocation Detection**: For each point, searches for other points within the specified tolerance distance.
3. **Count Assignment**: Writes the number of collocated points (including itself) to the specified attribute.
4. **Optional Indexing**: If enabled, assigns a linear occurrence index (0, 1, 2...) to each point within a collocated group.

## Behavior

```
Input Points:           Output Attributes:

A ● ● B (same pos)      A: NumCollocations=2, LinearOccurrences=0
                        B: NumCollocations=2, LinearOccurrences=1
C ●                     C: NumCollocations=1

D ● ● ● E F (same pos)  D: NumCollocations=3, LinearOccurrences=0
                        E: NumCollocations=3, LinearOccurrences=1
                        F: NumCollocations=3, LinearOccurrences=2
```

## Settings

### Node-Specific Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Collocation Num Attribute Name</strong> <code>FName</code></summary>

The name of the attribute to write collocation count to.

Default: `NumCollocations`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Write Linear Occurrences</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, writes the linear index of occurrence for collocated points. This assigns each point in a collocated group a unique index (0, 1, 2...) based on processing order.

Default: `false`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Linear Occurrences Attribute Name</strong> <code>FName</code></summary>

The name of the attribute to write linear occurrence indices to.

Default: `NumLinearOccurences`

📋 *Visible when Write Linear Occurrences is enabled*

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Tolerance</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

Distance tolerance for considering two points as collocated. Points within this distance are treated as sharing the same location.

Default: `DBL_COLLOCATION_TOLERANCE` (engine default)

⚡ PCG Overridable
