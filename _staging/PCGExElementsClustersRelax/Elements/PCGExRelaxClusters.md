# Cluster : Relax

Relax point positions using edges connecting them.

## Overview

This node iteratively adjusts vertex positions to create a more evenly-distributed graph layout. Each iteration moves vertices based on their connected neighbors, gradually smoothing out the overall structure. The relaxation process can use different algorithms to determine how vertices are repositioned relative to their neighbors.

## How It Works

1. **Initialize Buffers**: Creates position buffers to track vertex movement during relaxation.
2. **Iterate Relaxation**: For each iteration, calculates new positions for all vertices based on their neighbors and the selected relaxation algorithm.
3. **Apply Influence**: Blends the relaxed position with the original based on the influence setting, which can be progressive (ramping up over iterations).
4. **Output Results**: Updates vertex positions and optionally writes movement direction and amplitude to attributes.

#### Usage Notes

- **Iteration Count**: More iterations produce smoother results but take longer to compute. Start with lower values and increase as needed.
- **Progressive Influence**: When enabled, influence ramps up over iterations, creating a gentler transition that preserves some original structure.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Different relaxation operations produce different results - Laplacian smoothing averages neighbor positions, while spring-based methods simulate physical forces.

## Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Iterations</strong> <code>int32</code></summary>

Number of relaxation iterations to perform. More iterations produce a smoother, more evenly-distributed result.

Default: `10`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Relaxing</strong> <code>UPCGExRelaxClusterOperation</code></summary>

The relaxation algorithm to use. This is an instanced sub-node that determines how vertex positions are calculated from their neighbors.

Available operations include various smoothing and force-based algorithms.

### Influence Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Influence Input</strong> <code>EPCGExInputValueType</code></summary>

Whether to use a constant influence value or read it from a point attribute.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Constant** | Use a fixed influence value for all points |
| **Attribute** | Read influence per-point from an attribute |

Default: `Constant`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Influence</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

How much the relaxation affects vertex positions. A value of 1.0 fully applies the relaxed position, while lower values blend between original and relaxed positions.

Default: `1.0`

📋 *Visible when Influence Input = Constant*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Progressive Influence</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, the influence ramps up progressively over iterations rather than being applied at full strength from the start. This creates a smoother transition and preserves more of the original structure.

Default: `true`
