# Fill Control : Count

Stop fill after a certain number of vtx have been captured.

## Overview

This fill control sub-node limits how many vertices each seed can capture during flood fill. Once a seed has claimed the maximum number of vertices, it stops expanding further. This provides a simple way to constrain the size of each diffusion region.

## How It Works

1. **Track Captures**: Counts the number of vertices each diffusion has successfully captured.
2. **Check Limit**: Before capturing a new vertex, checks if the count would exceed the maximum.
3. **Stop When Full**: When the limit is reached, the diffusion stops accepting new vertices.

#### Usage Notes

- **Per-Seed Limit**: Each seed has its own independent count. If Max Count is 10, each seed can capture up to 10 vertices.
- **Capture Only**: This control only validates captures (when a vertex is claimed), not probes or candidates.
- **Attribute-Driven**: Use attribute input to give different seeds different capture limits.

## Behavior

```
Count Limit (MaxCount = 5):

Seed → [1] → [2] → [3] → [4] → [5] → STOP
        ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓
Count:  1     2     3     4     5 (limit reached)

Multiple Seeds with same limit:
  Seed A: captures 5 vertices, then stops
  Seed B: captures 5 vertices, then stops
  (Total: 10 vertices captured)
```

## Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Max Count Input</strong> <code>EPCGExInputValueType</code></summary>

Whether the maximum count comes from a constant or attribute.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Constant** | Use a fixed count limit |
| **Attribute** | Read count limit from an attribute |

Default: `Constant`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Max Count (Attr)</strong> <code>FName</code></summary>

Attribute name to read the count limit from.

Default: `MaxCount`
