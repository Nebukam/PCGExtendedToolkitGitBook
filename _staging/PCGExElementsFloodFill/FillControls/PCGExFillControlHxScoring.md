# Fill Control : Heuristics Scoring

Compute and accumulate heuristic scores for diffusion candidates.

## Overview

This fill control sub-node computes heuristic scores for diffusion candidates using connected heuristic sub-nodes. Unlike Heuristics Budget, this control only scores candidates without imposing stopping conditions. The scores influence candidate priority during expansion but don't block diffusion.

## How It Works

1. **Receive Heuristics**: Accepts heuristic sub-nodes via the Heuristics input pin.
2. **Score Candidates**: For each candidate, computes scores using all connected heuristics.
3. **Combine Scores**: Combines multiple heuristic scores using the selected scoring mode.
4. **Weight and Apply**: Applies the score weight and updates candidate priority.

#### Usage Notes

- **Scoring Only**: This control only scores, it never stops diffusion. Use Heuristics Budget or Heuristics Threshold if you need stopping conditions.
- **Priority Influence**: Higher scores give candidates higher priority during expansion.
- **Multiple Controls**: Can be combined with other scoring controls - scores are accumulated.

## Behavior

#### Heuristics Scoring:
```
Candidates scored by connected heuristics:
  [Vtx A] → Score: 0.8 (high priority)
  [Vtx B] → Score: 0.3 (low priority)
  [Vtx C] → Score: 0.6 (medium priority)

Expansion order influenced by scores:
  A (0.8) → C (0.6) → B (0.3)
```

#### Scoring Components:
```
  Local Score:    Score for this specific candidate
  Global Score:   Score relative to all candidates
  Previous Score: Inherited score from parent in path
```

## Inputs

| Pin | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **Heuristics** | Params | Heuristic sub-nodes for computing candidate scores |

## Settings

How to combine scores when multiple heuristics are connected.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Weighted Average** | Average scores weighted by each heuristic's weight factor |
| **Min** | Use the minimum score across all heuristics |
| **Max** | Use the maximum score across all heuristics |
| **Sum** | Sum all heuristic scores |

Default: `WeightedAverage`

Bitmask controlling which score components are used.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Local Score** | Score computed for this specific candidate |
| **Global Score** | Score relative to all candidates in the search |
| **Previous Score** | Score inherited from the parent node in the path |

Default: `LocalScore`

<details>
<summary><strong>Score Weight</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

Multiplier applied to scores from this control. Higher values give this control more influence when combined with other scoring controls.

Default: `1.0`

Minimum: 0

### Inherited Settings

This control does not use Source or Steps settings (scoring only, no validation).
