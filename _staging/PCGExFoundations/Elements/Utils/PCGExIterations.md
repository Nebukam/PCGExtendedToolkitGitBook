# Iterations

Generates dummy data entries to drive loop iterations.

## Overview

This node creates multiple duplicate entries of a lightweight dummy data object to serve as iteration drivers for loop nodes. Instead of providing actual data, it outputs N identical data entries that PCG loop nodes can iterate over. This is useful for controlling loop counts when you need a specific number of iterations without depending on input data.

## How It Works

1. **Type Selection**: Determines the PCG data type to output (Params, Points, Spline, etc.)
2. **Data Creation**: Creates a single lightweight dummy data object
3. **Duplication**: Adds N duplicate references to the same object
4. **Utils Generation** (optional): Adds per-iteration index/progress attributes
5. **Output**: Produces N data entries for loop consumption

#### Usage Notes

- **Loop Control**: This node is primarily used to drive loop nodes when you need a specific number of iterations regardless of input data.
- **Lightweight**: The dummy data is minimal - all iterations reference the same underlying object to minimize memory.
- **Subgraph Compatibility**: Using typed outputs (Points, Spline, etc.) allows subgraphs to work both as loops and as regular processing graphs with properly typed pins.
- **No Input Required**: This node doesn't require input data - it generates iteration drivers independently.

## Behavior

#### Basic Iteration Generation:
```
Iterations: 5
Type: Attribute Set (Params)

Output: 5 identical param data entries
→ Loop node processes 5 times
```

#### Loop Integration:
```
[Iterations] → Iterations: 10
  ↓
[Loop] → Processes 10 times
  ↓ Each iteration
[Your Processing]
```

#### Without Iterations Node:
```
[Data with 3 collections]
  ↓
[Loop] → Processes 3 times (once per collection)
```

#### With Iterations Node Override:
```
[Iterations] → Iterations: 100
  ↓ (overrides data count)
[Loop] → Processes 100 times
```

#### Output Utils:
```
bOutputUtils = true
Iterations: 5

Each iteration entry gets attributes:
- Index: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (current iteration)
- Progress: 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 (normalized 0-1)

Useful for progress-driven operations within loop
```

#### Data Types:
```
Type = Attribute Set (Params):
  Outputs param data (lightweight)
  Most efficient for pure iteration

Type = Points:
  Outputs point data (single point per entry)
  Compatible with point-processing loops

Type = Spline:
  Outputs spline data
  For spline-aware loop contexts

Type = Texture:
  Outputs texture data
  For texture processing loops

Type = Any:
  Untyped pin (flexible connection)
```

Good for: loop count control, fixed iterations, batch processing, repetition control

## Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Type</strong> <code>EPCGExIterationDataType</code></summary>

Type of dummy data to generate.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Any** | Untyped pin (attribute set internally) |
| **Attribute Set** (default) | Param data (most efficient) |
| **Points** | Point data (single point per entry) |
| **Spline** | Spline data |
| **Texture** | Texture data |

Choosing the right type ensures pin compatibility with downstream loop nodes.

**Attribute Set**: Best for pure iteration control (lightweight)
**Points**: When loop expects point data
**Spline/Texture**: For specialized loop contexts

Default: `Attribute Set`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Iterations</strong> <code>int32</code></summary>

Number of iteration entries to generate.

This determines how many times a connected loop will execute.

Examples:
- `10`: Loop processes 10 times
- `100`: Loop processes 100 times
- `0`: No iterations (loop skipped)

Default: `0`

Range: `0` to max int

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Output Utils</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Output per-iteration param data with useful index and progress attributes.

When enabled, each iteration entry contains:
- **Index**: Current iteration number (0, 1, 2, ...)
- **Progress**: Normalized progress (0.0 to 1.0)

Less optimized than the basic version but provides iteration context.

📋 *Visible when Type = Attribute Set*

Default: `false`

## Practical Examples

**Fixed Iteration Count:**
```
[Iterations: 20]
  ↓
[Loop]
  ↓
[Spawn Random Points] → Executes 20 times
```

**Batch Processing:**
```
[Iterations: 50]
  ↓
[Loop]
  ↓
[Heavy Operation] → Splits work into 50 batches
```

**Progress-Driven Effects:**
```
[Iterations: 100, OutputUtils: true]
  ↓
[Loop]
  ↓
[Use Progress Attribute] → Fade/ramp effect over 100 steps
```

**Override Data-Driven Loops:**
```
[Data: 3 collections] ──→ [Loop] (would process 3×)
[Iterations: 10] ────────↗ (overrides to 10×)
```

## Inputs

| Pin | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| (none) | - | No inputs required |

## Outputs

| Pin | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **Iterations** | Varies by Type | N duplicate dummy data entries for loop driving |
