# Cluster : Convex Hull 2D

Create a 2D Convex Hull triangulation for each input dataset.

> **Deprecated as of 5.4** - Use *Find Convex Hull 2D* instead.

## Overview

This node computes the 2D convex hull of each input point set by projecting points onto a plane and finding the outer boundary. The result can be output as either a cluster (vertices + edges) or as paths. The convex hull represents the smallest convex polygon that encloses all projected points.

## How It Works

1. **Projection**: Projects input points onto a 2D plane using the specified projection settings
2. **Hull Computation**: Calculates the convex hull boundary of the projected points
3. **Output Generation**: Creates either a cluster with vertices and edges, or a path, with the specified winding order

#### Usage Notes

- **Minimum Points**: Requires at least 3 non-collinear points (after projection) to form a valid hull.
- **Projection Plane**: Points are flattened to 2D using the projection settings; the projection direction determines which axis is ignored.
- **Output Mode**: When outputting as paths instead of clusters, only the boundary vertices are included without edge data.

## Behavior

```
Input Points              Output Cluster
(3D scattered)            (2D hull boundary)

    •     •                   ┌─────┐
   •    •        →            │     │
  •  •    •                   └─────┘
    •                     Projected boundary
                          with specified winding
```
