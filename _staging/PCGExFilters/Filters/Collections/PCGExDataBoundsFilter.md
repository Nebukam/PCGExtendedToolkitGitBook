# Data Filter : Bounds

Test an aspect of the collection's bounds against a comparison value.

## Overview

This filter evaluates geometric properties of a data collection's bounding box. It can test various bound aspects such as volume, extents, size ratios, and individual axis values against constant or attribute-based comparison values. The filter operates at the collection level, passing or failing entire point sets.

## How It Works

1. **Aspect Extraction**: Extracts the selected geometric property from the collection's bounds.
2. **Component Selection**: For vector-based aspects, extracts the specified component (length, X, Y, or Z).
3. **Comparison**: Compares the extracted value against the operand using the selected comparison operator.
4. **Result**: Returns pass if the comparison succeeds, fail otherwise.

#### Usage Notes

- **Collection Filter**: This filter evaluates at the data set level, not per-point.
- **Bounds Calculation**: Uses the combined bounding box of all points in the collection.
- **Aspect Ratios**: Useful for filtering based on collection shape (flat, elongated, cubic).

## Behavior

**Volume Check Example:**
```
Collection bounds: 100x50x25

Config: Aspect=Volume, OperandB > 100000
Volume = 100 * 50 * 25 = 125000
Result: Pass (125000 > 100000)
```

**Ratio Check Example:**
```
Collection bounds: 100x50x25

Config: Aspect=Ratio (XY), OperandB > 1.5
Ratio XY = 100/50 = 2.0
Result: Pass (2.0 > 1.5)
```

## Settings

<details>
<summary><strong>Operand A</strong> <code>EPCGExDataBoundsAspect</code></summary>

The bounds aspect to test.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Extents** | Half-size of the bounding box (center to edge) |
| **Min** | Minimum corner of the bounding box |
| **Max** | Maximum corner of the bounding box |
| **Size** | Full size of the bounding box |
| **Volume** | Total volume of the bounding box |
| **Ratio** | Aspect ratio between two axes |
| **Ratio (Sorted)** | Aspect ratio of largest to smallest axis |

Default: `Volume`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sub Operand</strong> <code>EPCGExDataBoundsComponent</code></summary>

Which component to extract from vector-based aspects.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Length** | Vector length (magnitude) |
| **Length Squared** | Squared vector length (faster, no sqrt) |
| **X** | X component |
| **Y** | Y component |
| **Z** | Z component |

📋 *Visible when Operand A is Extents, Min, Max, or Size*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Ratio</strong> <code>EPCGExDataBoundsRatio</code></summary>

Which axis pair to use for aspect ratio calculation.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **XY** | X divided by Y |

Default: `XY`

📋 *Visible when Operand A = Ratio*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Operand B</strong> <code>FPCGExCompareSelectorDouble</code></summary>

The comparison configuration including operator and value to compare against. Can use a constant value or read from an attribute.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Invert</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>
