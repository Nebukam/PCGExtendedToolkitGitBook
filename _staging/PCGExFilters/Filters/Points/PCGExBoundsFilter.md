# Filter : Inclusion (Bounds)

Tests whether points intersect or are contained within target bounding volumes.

## Overview

This filter evaluates the spatial relationship between input points and a set of target bounds provided via an input pin. It supports various check types including intersection, containment, and boundary tests. Points can be tested against individual per-point bounds or collection-level bounds, using either box or sphere approximations.

## How It Works

1. **Bounds Collection**: Gathers oriented bounding boxes from the connected bounds data.
2. **Point Evaluation**: For each input point, tests its position or bounds against all target bounds.
3. **Check Type**: Performs the configured spatial test (intersects, inside, etc.).
4. **Result Aggregation**: Returns pass if any target bound satisfies the check condition.

#### Usage Notes

- **Bounds Input**: Requires a "Bounds" input pin with point data defining the test volumes.
- **Self-Filtering**: Can optionally ignore self-intersection when testing against the same collection.
- **Expansion**: Use expansion to create tolerance zones around target bounds.

## Behavior

**Check Type Examples:**
```
Target Bounds: [Box at origin, 100x100x100]

Point A (inside):      Position (10, 10, 10)
Point B (on surface):  Position (50, 0, 0)
Point C (outside):     Position (200, 0, 0)
Point D (intersects):  Position (60, 0, 0) with 20-unit radius bounds

Intersects:           A=Pass, B=Pass, C=Fail, D=Pass
Is Inside:            A=Pass, B=Fail, C=Fail, D=Fail
Is Inside or On:      A=Pass, B=Pass, C=Fail, D=Fail
Is Inside or Intersects: A=Pass, B=Pass, C=Fail, D=Pass
```
