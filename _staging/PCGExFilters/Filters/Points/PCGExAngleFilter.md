# Filter : Angle

Compares the dot product of directions between a point and its neighbors.

## Overview

This filter evaluates the angular relationship at each point by comparing the directions to its previous and next neighbors. It can measure either curvature (how much the path bends at a point) or spread (the angle formed by looking toward both neighbors). The filter respects closed loop settings and provides fallback behavior for endpoint handling.

## How It Works

1. **Direction Calculation**: Computes direction vectors between the current point and its neighbors.
2. **Mode Selection**: Calculates either curvature or spread based on the selected mode.
3. **Dot Product**: Computes the dot product between the relevant direction vectors, measuring alignment.
4. **Comparison**: Tests the dot product against the configured threshold.
5. **Endpoint Handling**: Uses fallback values for first/last points unless the path is closed.

#### Usage Notes

- **Path Data**: Works best with ordered point sequences representing paths or splines.
- **Closed Loops**: Automatically wraps at endpoints when `@Data.IsClosed` attribute is true.
- **Dot Product Range**: Values range from -1 (opposite directions) to 1 (same direction).

## Behavior

**Curvature Mode:**
```
Measures how much the path bends at a point.
Dot of: (Prev → Current) · (Current → Next)

Straight path: Dot ≈ 1.0 (vectors aligned)
90° turn:      Dot ≈ 0.0 (vectors perpendicular)
180° turn:     Dot ≈ -1.0 (vectors opposite)

    Prev ----→ Current ----→ Next   [Dot = 1.0, straight]

    Prev ----→ Current
                  ↓
                 Next              [Dot = 0.0, 90° turn]
```

**Spread Mode:**
```
Measures the angle formed by looking toward both neighbors.
Dot of: (Current → Prev) · (Current → Next)

Neighbors opposite:  Dot ≈ -1.0 (180° spread)
Neighbors at 90°:    Dot ≈ 0.0 (90° spread)
Neighbors close:     Dot ≈ 1.0 (narrow spread)

    Prev ←---- Current ----→ Next   [Dot = -1.0, 180° spread]

         Prev
           ↑
         Current ----→ Next         [Dot = 0.0, 90° spread]
```
