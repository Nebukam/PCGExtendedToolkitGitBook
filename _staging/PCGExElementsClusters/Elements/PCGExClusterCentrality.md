# Cluster : Centrality

Compute centrality (betweenness, closeness, degree, eigenvector, katz).

## Overview

This node computes a centrality score for each vertex in a cluster, quantifying how structurally important each vertex is within the graph. Different algorithms capture different notions of importance: whether a vertex acts as a bridge between regions (betweenness), sits close to everything (closeness), has many direct connections (degree), or is connected to other well-connected vertices (eigenvector/katz). The six available algorithms fall into three families -- path-based, local, and iterative -- each revealing different aspects of graph structure. The computed score is written to a configurable output attribute, with optional normalization and contrast adjustment.

## How It Works

1. **Algorithm Selection**: Choose a centrality type that defines the importance metric.
2. **Score Computation**: The selected algorithm evaluates every vertex in the cluster:
   - *Path-based* (Betweenness, Closeness, Harmonic Closeness): runs shortest-path queries using connected heuristic sub-nodes to weight edges.
   - *Local* (Degree): counts direct connections per vertex.
   - *Iterative* (Eigenvector, Katz): repeatedly refines scores until convergence.
3. **Normalization**: Optionally scales all scores to the 0-1 range relative to the highest value.
4. **Contrast**: Optionally reshapes the value distribution using a contrast curve.
5. **Output**: Writes the final score to the specified attribute on each vertex.

#### Usage Notes

- **Heuristics Input**: Path-based centrality types (Betweenness, Closeness, Harmonic Closeness) require heuristic sub-nodes connected to the Heuristics pin. These control edge weighting during shortest-path computation. Degree, Eigenvector, and Katz do not use heuristics.
- **Downsampling**: For large clusters, path-based centrality can be approximated by computing on a random subset of source nodes, trading precision for speed.
- **Attribute Output**: The result is a single `double` attribute per vertex. Use normalization and contrast to shape the distribution for downstream use.

## Behavior

**All six centrality types on the same graph:**
```
Graph:
  A───B───C───D
      │
      E───F

                    A     B     C     D     E     F
                   ───   ───   ───   ───   ───   ───
Degree:             1     3     2     1     2     1
Betweenness:        0     6     3     0     3     0
Closeness:         .125  .200  .167  .100  .167  .125
Harmonic:          1.83  3.17  2.67  1.83  2.67  1.83
Eigenvector:       .27   .58   .49   .22   .49   .27
Katz (α=0.1):      .30   .62   .51   .23   .51   .30
```

**Degree** -- counts direct connections. B has 3 edges (to A, C, E), so it scores highest.
This is purely local: a vertex deep in a chain scores the same as one at a critical
junction, as long as they have the same number of edges.

**Betweenness** -- counts how many shortest paths between other vertex pairs pass through
this vertex. B scores highest because it sits on every shortest path between the upper
branch (A) and the lower branch (E, F), and between the left and right sides. D and F
score 0 because they are leaf nodes -- no shortest path needs to go through them.
Vertices with high betweenness act as bridges or gatekeepers between graph regions.

**Closeness** -- measures how easily a vertex can reach all others, computed as 1 divided
by the sum of shortest distances to every other vertex. B scores highest because it has
the lowest total distance to all other vertices. Closeness identifies the most
"accessible" positions in the graph. Note: closeness produces undefined results if the
graph has disconnected components (infinite distances).

**Harmonic Closeness** -- similar to closeness but sums the *inverse* of each individual
distance (1/d₁ + 1/d₂ + ...) rather than inverting the total sum. This handles
disconnected components gracefully: unreachable vertices contribute 0 instead of making
the result undefined. The relative ranking is similar to closeness on connected graphs
but the raw values differ.

**Eigenvector** -- a vertex scores high not just for having many connections, but for
being connected to other high-scoring vertices. This is computed iteratively: each vertex's
score is proportional to the sum of its neighbors' scores, refined until convergence. In
this example, C and E score similarly to each other (both have degree 2), but C edges
slightly ahead because one of its neighbors (B) has a higher score than F. Eigenvector
captures "prestige" -- importance through association.

**Katz** -- similar to eigenvector but considers *all* paths between vertices, not just
direct connections, with an exponential decay factor (alpha) controlling how quickly
distant paths lose influence. Every vertex also receives a baseline score, so isolated
vertices are never exactly zero. Lower alpha values make Katz behave more like degree
(emphasizing local connections), while higher values approach eigenvector-like behavior
(emphasizing global structure).

**Normalization and Contrast:**
```
Raw betweenness: [0, 6, 3, 0, 3, 0]

Normalized (0-1): [0, 1.0, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 0]

OneMinus:         [1.0, 0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0]

Contrast (SCurve, Amount=2.0):
  Values near 0 and 1 are pushed further apart,
  mid-range values shift toward extremes.
```
