# Path : To Clusters

Merge paths to edge clusters for glorious pathfinding inception.

## Overview

This node converts path point collections into cluster graphs. Each path becomes a chain of connected edges, and when fusing is enabled, overlapping paths are merged into a unified graph with proper intersection handling.

This is a **key node for the Cluster ↔ Path workflow cycle**: pathfinding operations output paths, but many PCGEx operations require clusters. This node bridges that gap, allowing pathfinding results to be re-integrated into the cluster ecosystem for further operations.

## How It Works

1. **Path Processing**: Converts each path into a sequence of vertices and edges
2. **Fusing** (optional): Merges overlapping points based on proximity
3. **Point-Edge Intersections** (optional): Detects where points lie on edges and splits accordingly
4. **Edge-Edge Intersections** (optional): Detects edge crossings and creates intersection vertices
5. **Attribute Blending**: Merges attributes when points or edges are fused together
6. **Graph Output**: Produces a unified cluster graph

#### Usage Notes

- **Fusing Enabled**: Paths that share points (within fuse distance) become connected, creating a unified navigable network.
- **Fusing Disabled**: Each path becomes an independent cluster with no connections to other paths.
- **Intersection Detection**: Enable Point-Edge and Edge-Edge intersections for complete topology but at increased cost.

## Behavior

```
WITHOUT FUSING:                 WITH FUSING:
Path A: ●───●───●               ●───●───●
Path B: ●───●───●                   │
        (overlapping)           ●───●───●
                                (shared vertex)

WITH EDGE-EDGE INTERSECTIONS:
    ●                               ●
    │                               │
●───┼───●           ══►         ●───●───●
    │                               │
    ●                               ●
(paths cross)                  (intersection vertex)
```
