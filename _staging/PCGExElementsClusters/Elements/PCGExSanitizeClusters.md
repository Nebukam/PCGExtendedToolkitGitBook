# Cluster : Sanitize

Ensure the input set of vertex and edges outputs clean, interconnected clusters. May create new clusters, but does not create nor delete points/edges.

## Overview

This node validates and reorganizes cluster data to ensure proper connectivity. It analyzes the input vertices and edges, identifies disconnected sub-graphs, and outputs them as separate clean clusters. The node ensures that each output cluster is a fully connected component where all vertices are reachable from any other vertex through edges.

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Connectivity**: Examines all vertices and edges to identify which vertices are connected to each other.
2. **Identify Components**: Finds all disconnected sub-graphs (connected components) within the input data.
3. **Rebuild Clusters**: Outputs each connected component as a separate, valid cluster.
4. **Apply Filters**: Optionally removes clusters that are too small or too large based on vertex/edge count thresholds.

#### Usage Notes

- **No Point Deletion**: This node never deletes points or edges - it only reorganizes them into proper clusters.
- **Cluster Splitting**: A single input edge set may produce multiple output clusters if the graph contains disconnected components.
- **Isolated Points**: Isolated points (vertices with no edges) are handled according to the inherited cluster processor settings.

### Inherited Settings

This node inherits common cluster processing settings from its base class.

> See [Clusters Processor Settings](../Shared/ClustersProcessorSettings.md) for: Cluster handling, edge validation, and other common cluster configuration.

## Inputs

| Pin | Type | Description |
