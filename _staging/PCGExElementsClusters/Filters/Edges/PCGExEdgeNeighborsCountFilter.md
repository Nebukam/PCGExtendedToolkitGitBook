# Edge Filter : Num Vtx

Filters edges based on the number of neighbors (adjacency count) at their endpoint vertices.

## Overview

This edge filter evaluates the neighbor count at edge endpoints and compares the result against a threshold. The mode determines how endpoint neighbor counts are combined — using the sum of both endpoints, requiring any endpoint to meet the threshold, or requiring both endpoints to meet it. This allows you to filter edges based on connectivity patterns, such as keeping only edges between well-connected vertices or removing edges that connect to leaf nodes.

## How It Works

1. **Neighbor Counting**: Counts the number of adjacent vertices (neighbors) at both the start and end vertices of each edge.
2. **Mode Application**: Combines the counts based on the selected mode (Sum, Any, or Both).
3. **Threshold Comparison**: Compares the result against the threshold using the selected comparison operator.
4. **Result**: The edge passes or fails based on the comparison result and invert setting.

#### Usage Notes

- **Sum Mode**: Adds neighbor counts from both endpoints before comparing.
- **Any Mode**: Edge passes if either endpoint's neighbor count meets the threshold.
- **Both Mode**: Edge passes only if both endpoints' neighbor counts meet the threshold.
- **Self-Edges**: The neighbor count typically includes the edge itself, so isolated edges have at least 1 neighbor per endpoint.

## Behavior

```
Mode Examples (Threshold = 3, Comparison = EqualOrGreater):

Sum Mode:
  [2 neighbors]---[2 neighbors] → PASS (sum = 4 >= 3)
  [1 neighbor]---[1 neighbor]   → FAIL (sum = 2 < 3)

Any Mode:
  [3 neighbors]---[1 neighbor]  → PASS (3 >= 3)
  [2 neighbors]---[1 neighbor]  → FAIL (neither >= 3)

Both Mode:
  [3 neighbors]---[4 neighbors] → PASS (both >= 3)
  [3 neighbors]---[2 neighbors] → FAIL (one < 3)
```

| **NearlyEqual** | Count ≈ Threshold (within tolerance) |
| **NearlyNotEqual** | Count !≈ Threshold (outside tolerance) |

Default: `EqualOrGreater`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Tolerance</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

Tolerance value for approximate comparison modes (NearlyEqual, NearlyNotEqual).

Default: `DBL_COMPARE_TOLERANCE`

📋 *Visible when Comparison = NearlyEqual or NearlyNotEqual*
