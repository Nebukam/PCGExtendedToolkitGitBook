# Goal Picker : Default

Default goal picker that pairs seeds with goals by index.

## Overview

This is the base goal picker used by pathfinding nodes. It pairs each seed point with a goal point based on their index positions. The index safety setting controls how out-of-range indices are handled when there are more seeds than goals.

## How It Works

1. **Read Seed Index**: Gets the index of the current seed point.
2. **Apply Safety**: Maps the index using the safety mode (tile, clamp, etc.).
3. **Return Goal**: Returns the goal at the resulting index.

#### Usage Notes

- **Index-Based**: Seed 0 pairs with Goal 0, Seed 1 with Goal 1, etc.
- **Index Safety**: When seed count exceeds goal count, the safety mode determines mapping.
- **Single Goal**: Each seed produces one path to its paired goal.

## Behavior

```
Index-Based Pairing:

Seeds: [S0, S1, S2, S3, S4]
Goals: [G0, G1, G2]

Index Safety = Tile:
   S0 → G0, S1 → G1, S2 → G2, S3 → G0, S4 → G1

Index Safety = Clamp:
   S0 → G0, S1 → G1, S2 → G2, S3 → G2, S4 → G2

Index Safety = Yoyo:
   S0 → G0, S1 → G1, S2 → G2, S3 → G1, S4 → G0
```

How to handle seed indices that exceed the goal count.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ignore** | Invalid indices are skipped (no path created) |
| **Tile** | Wraps around using modulo (0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2...) |
| **Clamp** | Clamps to last valid index |
| **Yoyo** | Bounces back and forth (0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1...) |

Default: `Tile`
