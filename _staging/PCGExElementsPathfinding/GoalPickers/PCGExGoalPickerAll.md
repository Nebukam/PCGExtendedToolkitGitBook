# Goal Picker : All

Each seed creates paths to all goals.

## Overview

This goal picker creates paths from each seed point to every goal point. If you have 3 seeds and 5 goals, this produces 15 paths (3 × 5). This is useful for computing full connectivity between sets of points.

## How It Works

1. **Enumerate Goals**: Gets the total count of goal points.
2. **Return All Indices**: For each seed, returns all goal indices.
3. **Create Paths**: The pathfinding node creates one path per seed-goal pair.

#### Usage Notes

- **Multiplicative Output**: Path count = Seeds × Goals.
- **Memory Intensive**: Large seed and goal counts can produce many paths.
- **Full Connectivity**: Every seed connects to every goal.

## Behavior

```
All-Goals Pairing:

Seeds: [S0, S1]
Goals: [G0, G1, G2]

Output Paths:
   S0 → G0
   S0 → G1
   S0 → G2
   S1 → G0
   S1 → G1
   S1 → G2

Total: 2 seeds × 3 goals = 6 paths
```

## Settings

This picker has no additional settings beyond those inherited from the base goal picker.

### Inherited Settings

→ See [Goal Picker : Default](PCGExGoalPicker.md) for base settings (Index Safety is not used since all goals are selected).
