# Pathfinding : Find Cells

Attempts to find a closed cell of connected edges around seed points.

## Overview

This node finds closed polygonal cells in a cluster graph that contain or are nearest to input seed points. Unlike Find All Cells which discovers every cell, this node targets specific locations based on seed positions. Seeds can optionally expand to claim adjacent cells, and ownership conflicts are resolved based on configurable rules.

## How It Works

1. **Map Seeds**: Associates each seed point with its nearest cluster node or edge.
2. **Find Cells**: Traces closed polygonal cells containing each seed.
3. **Resolve Ownership**: When multiple seeds claim the same cell, applies ownership rules.
4. **Expand Seeds**: Optionally grows seed influence to adjacent cells.
5. **Output Cells**: Builds path data for each valid cell.

#### Usage Notes

- **Seed Picking**: Configure how seeds find their target cluster node (closest edge or node).
- **Ownership Modes**: Seed Order (first wins), Closest (by distance), Best Candidate (by score).
- **Expansion**: Seeds can grow to claim neighboring cells up to a configurable depth.
- **Filtered Seeds**: Optionally output which seeds succeeded or failed to find cells.

## Behavior

```
Seed-Based Cell Detection:

Cluster with Seeds:
    [A]───[B]───[C]
     │ ╲S1╱ │ ╲ ╱ │
    [D]───[E]───[F]
     │ ╱ ╲ │ ╲S2╱ │
    [G]───[H]───[I]

S1 finds cell ABE-D
S2 finds cell EFI-H

Output: Two cell contours, one per seed
Good Seeds: S1, S2
Bad Seeds: (none if both found cells)
```
