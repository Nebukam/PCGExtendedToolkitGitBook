# Pathfinding : Find All Cells (Bounded)

Finds all cluster cells and triages them by spatial bounds relationship (Inside/Touching/Outside).

## Overview

This node extends Find All Cells by classifying discovered cells based on their spatial relationship to input bounds. Cells are categorized as Inside (fully contained), Touching (intersecting), or Outside (no overlap) the bounds region. Results can be output to separate pins or combined with tags.

## How It Works

1. **Find Cells**: Traces all closed polygonal cells in the cluster graph.
2. **Classify Cells**: Tests each cell against the input bounds.
3. **Apply Constraints**: Filters cells based on size, area, and other criteria.
4. **Triage Output**: Routes cells to appropriate outputs based on bounds relationship.

#### Usage Notes

- **Bounds Input**: Connect point data whose bounds define the test region.
- **Triage Flags**: Select which categories (Inside/Touching/Outside) to output.
- **Combined Mode**: Outputs all cells to one pin with classification tags.
- **Separate Mode**: Outputs cells to distinct pins per classification.

## Behavior

```
Cell Classification:

Bounds Region:      ┌─────────────┐
                    │   BOUNDS    │
                    └─────────────┘

Cell A:  ████       Cell B:  ████     Cell C:    ████
        ████               ████               ████
   (Outside)          (Touching)          (Inside)

Output (Separate Mode):
   Paths : Inside   → Cell C
   Paths : Touching → Cell B
   Paths : Outside  → Cell A
```
