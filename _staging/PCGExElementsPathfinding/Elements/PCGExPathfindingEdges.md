# Pathfinding : Edges

Extract paths from edges clusters.

## Overview

This node finds paths through cluster graphs by navigating from seed points to goal points along edges. It uses configurable search algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, etc.) guided by heuristics to find optimal or near-optimal paths. The output is a collection of path point data representing the traversed routes through the cluster.

## How It Works

1. **Map Seeds/Goals**: Associates seed and goal points with their nearest cluster nodes.
2. **Pair Queries**: Uses the Goal Picker to determine which goals each seed should path to.
3. **Execute Search**: Runs the search algorithm with connected heuristics to find paths.
4. **Build Paths**: Constructs output path data from the discovered routes.

#### Usage Notes

- **Cluster Required**: Input must be a valid cluster with vertices and edges.
- **Heuristics**: Connect heuristic sub-nodes to guide path selection (distance, steepness, etc.).
- **Goal Picker**: Determines path-goal pairing strategy (all goals, random, attribute-based).
- **Memory vs Speed**: Disable "Greedy Queries" to reduce memory at the cost of speed.

## Behavior

```
Pathfinding Flow:

Seeds (3 points)     Goals (2 points)
    S1 ─────────────────► G1
    S2 ─────────────────► G1
    S3 ─────────────────► G2

Cluster Graph:
    [A]───[B]───[C]
     │     │     │
    [D]───[E]───[F]
     │     │     │
    [G]───[H]───[I]

S1 near [A], G1 near [I]:
    Path: A → B → E → H → I

Output: Path collection with one path per seed-goal pair
```

## Settings

### Path Composition

<details>
<summary><strong>Goal Picker</strong> <code>UPCGExGoalPicker</code></summary>

Controls how goals are selected for each seed point. This is an instanced sub-node.

Available pickers:
- **All**: Each seed paths to every goal
- **Random**: Each seed paths to a randomly selected goal
- **Attribute**: Goal selection based on matching attributes

<details>
<summary><strong>Add Seed to Path</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

When enabled, includes the original seed point at the beginning of each output path.

Default: `false`
