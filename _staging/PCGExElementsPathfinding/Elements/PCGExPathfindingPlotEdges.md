# Pathfinding : Plot Edges

Extract a single path from edges clusters, going through every seed points in order.

## Overview

This node generates a continuous path that visits a sequence of plot (waypoint) points in order, finding the optimal route between consecutive waypoints through the cluster graph. Unlike regular pathfinding which goes from one seed to one goal, this creates a single path connecting multiple waypoints in sequence.

## How It Works

1. **Match Plots to Clusters**: Associates plot collections with their target clusters.
2. **Map Waypoints**: Finds the nearest cluster nodes for each plot point.
3. **Path Between Points**: Uses the search algorithm to find paths between consecutive waypoints.
4. **Concatenate Segments**: Joins all path segments into a single continuous path.
5. **Optionally Close Loop**: Can connect the last point back to the first.

#### Usage Notes

- **Ordered Sequence**: Plot points are visited in their input order.
- **Closed Loop**: Enable to path from the last waypoint back to the first.
- **Failed Segments**: If any segment fails, optionally omit the entire path.
- **Plot Point Insertion**: Original plot points can be inserted into the output path.

## Behavior

```
Plot-Based Path Generation:

Plot Points (A, B, C, D) in order:

Cluster Graph:
    [1]───[2]───[3]───[4]───[5]
     │     │     │     │     │
    [6]───[7]───[8]───[9]───[10]
     │     │     │     │     │
   [11]──[12]──[13]──[14]──[15]

A near [1], B near [5], C near [15], D near [11]

Resulting Path: 1→2→3→4→5→10→15→14→13→12→11
                  (A→B) → (B→C) → (C→D)

Closed Loop: ...→11→6→1 (D back to A)
```
