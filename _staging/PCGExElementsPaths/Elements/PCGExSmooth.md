# Path : Smooth

Smooth paths points.

## Overview

This node smooths path data by gathering neighboring points and blending their properties/attributes onto each target point. The smoothing method determines which neighbors are gathered and how they're weighted; the BlendOps configuration determines what gets blended and how. This architecture makes smoothing fully attribute-agnostic - the same operation can smooth positions, colors, custom attributes, or any combination.

## How It Works

1. **Select Method**: Use the configured smoothing algorithm (Moving Average or Radius-based).
2. **Gather Neighbors**: For each point, identify neighboring points based on the method's criteria.
3. **Compute Weights**: Calculate influence weight for each neighbor based on the method's algorithm.
4. **Blend via BlendOps**: Use the configured BlendOps to blend properties/attributes from neighbors onto the target point.
5. **Apply Influence**: Scale the blending effect by the influence value.

#### Usage Notes

{% hint style="info" %}
### BlendOps Required
This node requires BlendOps to define what gets blended. The `Weight` blend mode is typically a good default for smooth results, but other modes can produce different effects using the same neighbor weights.
{% endhint %}

- **Attribute-Agnostic**: The smoothing method only gathers neighbors and computes weights. BlendOps control which properties/attributes are affected and how they're blended.
- **Preserve Endpoints**: Enable Preserve Start/End to keep path endpoints unaffected while smoothing interior points.
- **Influence**: Values less than 1 reduce the blending strength. Negative values can push away from the blended result.
- **Iterative Smoothing**: For very smooth results, chain multiple smooth nodes with lower amounts rather than one with a very high amount.

## Behavior

#### Smoothing pipeline:
```
1. Smoothing Method gathers neighbors + weights:
        ●───●───[●]───●───●
            ↑    ↑    ↑
   weight: 0.5  1.0  0.5

2. BlendOps blend selected attributes using weights:
   Position: weighted average of neighbors
   Color: weighted average of neighbors
   Custom: weighted average of neighbors
   (based on BlendOps configuration)

3. Influence scales the final blend:
   result = lerp(original, blended, influence)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Smoothing Method</strong> <code>UPCGExSmoothingInstancedFactory</code></summary>

The algorithm used for gathering neighbors and computing weights.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[Moving Average](./Smoothing/PCGExMovingAverageSmoothing.md)** | Gathers neighbors within a sliding window along the path. |

### Influence

<details>
<summary><strong>Influence Input</strong> <code>EPCGExInputValueType</code></summary>

Source for the influence value.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Constant** | Use the constant Influence value. |
| **Attribute** | Read influence from a point attribute. |

Default: `Constant`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Influence</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

How much to apply the blending result.

- `1.0` - Fully apply blended values
- `0.5` - Blend halfway between original and result
- `0.0` - No change
