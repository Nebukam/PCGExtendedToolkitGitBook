# Path : Slide

Slide points of a path along the path, either toward the next or previous point.

## Overview

This node moves path points along their connecting segments toward neighboring points. Points can be slid by a relative percentage of the segment length or by an absolute distance. Original positions can be saved to an attribute and later restored.

## How It Works

1. **Determine Direction**: Based on settings, each point will slide toward its next or previous neighbor.
2. **Calculate Displacement**: Compute how far to move based on measure type (relative or discrete).
3. **Save Original Position**: Optionally store the pre-slide position in an attribute.
4. **Apply Slide**: Move each point along the path segment by the computed amount.

#### Usage Notes

- **Relative vs Discrete**: Relative mode (0.5 = halfway) adapts to segment length, producing consistent proportional movement. Discrete mode moves a fixed distance regardless of segment length.
- **Restore Mode**: Use Restore mode to undo a previous slide operation by reading positions back from the saved attribute.
- **Endpoint Behavior**: Endpoints have only one neighbor, so they can only slide in one valid direction.

## Behavior

#### Slide toward Next (relative = 0.5):
```
Before:     ●─────────●─────────●─────────●
            A         B         C         D

After:           ●────────●────────●──────●
                 A'       B'       C'     D
                 (each point slides halfway toward next)
```

#### Slide toward Previous (relative = 0.25):
```
Before:     ●─────────●─────────●─────────●

After:      ●───●────────●────────●────────
                (each slides 25% toward previous)
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Direction</strong> <code>EPCGExSlideDirection</code></summary>

Which direction to slide along the path.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Next** | Slide toward the next point on the path. |
| **Previous** | Slide toward the previous point on the path. |

Default: `Next`

<details>
<summary><strong>Amount Measure</strong> <code>EPCGExMeanMeasure</code></summary>

How the slide amount is interpreted.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Relative** | Amount is a fraction of segment length (0.5 = halfway). |
| **Discrete** | Amount is an absolute distance in world units. |

Default: `Relative`

📋 *Visible when Mode = Slide*

<details>
<summary><strong>Slide Amount Input</strong> <code>EPCGExInputValueType</code></summary>

Source for the slide amount value.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Constant** | Use the constant Slide Amount value. |
| **Attribute** | Read slide amount from a point attribute. |

Default: `Constant`

📋 *Visible when Mode = Slide*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Slide Amount</strong> <code>double</code></summary>

How much to slide. In Relative mode, 0.5 means halfway. In Discrete mode, this is the distance in world units.

Default: `0.5`

📋 *Visible when Mode = Slide and Slide Amount Input = Constant*

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Write Old Position</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Store the original position in an attribute before sliding. This allows using Restore mode later to undo the slide.

Default: `true`

📋 *Visible when Mode = Slide*

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Restore Position Attribute Name</strong> <code>FName</code></summary>

Name of the attribute to write original positions to (when sliding) or read from (when restoring).

Default: `PreSlidePosition`

📋 *Visible when Write Old Position = true or Mode = Restore*
