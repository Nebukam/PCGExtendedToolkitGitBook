# Orient Operation

Base factory for path orientation methods.

## Overview

This abstract base class defines the common interface and settings for all path orientation operations. Derived classes implement specific orientation algorithms while sharing common axis configuration.

## How It Works

1. **Prepare**: The operation is prepared with path data, allowing it to access neighboring points and path topology.
2. **Compute Orientation**: For each point, the derived operation computes a new transform based on its specific algorithm.
3. **Apply Axes**: The computed direction is mapped to the configured orient axis, with the up axis defining the secondary rotation constraint.

## Common Settings

All orient operations share these base settings:

### Orient Axis

The local axis that will be aligned with the computed forward direction.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Forward** | +X axis (Unreal default forward) |
| **Backward** | -X axis |
| **Right** | +Y axis |
| **Left** | -Y axis |
| **Up** | +Z axis |
| **Down** | -Z axis |

### Up Axis

The local axis that will be constrained toward world up (or a reference direction).

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Forward** | +X axis |
| **Backward** | -X axis |
| **Right** | +Y axis |
| **Left** | -Y axis |
| **Up** | +Z axis (default) |
| **Down** | -Z axis |

## Available Orient Operations

- **[Average](./PCGExOrientAverage.md)** - Averages directions to neighboring points for smooth orientation
- **[Look At](./PCGExOrientLookAt.md)** - Orients toward a target point, direction, or position
