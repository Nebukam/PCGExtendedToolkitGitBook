# Copy to Path

Deform points along a path/spline.

## Overview

This node takes input points and deforms them along target paths or splines. Points are distributed and transformed to follow the path's shape, with configurable interpolation, scaling, and twist effects.

## How It Works

1. **Match Data**: Paths are matched to point collections based on data matching settings.
2. **Build Splines**: Target paths are converted to splines with configurable point types and tangents.
3. **Calculate Bounds**: Input point bounds are computed to determine the deformation space.
4. **Distribute Points**: Points are mapped along the spline based on their position within the bounds.
5. **Apply Deformation**: Points are transformed to follow the spline, with optional scaling, twist, and masking.

#### Usage Notes

- **Axis Order**: Determines which axis of the input points maps to the spline direction. First axis = along spline.
- **Closed Loops**: When paths are closed loops, points can wrap seamlessly around the loop.
- **Target Masking**: Use mask settings to distribute points over only a portion of each path.

## Behavior

```
Input points:               Deformed along path:

  ● ● ● ● ●                      ●
  ● ● ● ● ●                   ●     ●
  ● ● ● ● ●         →       ●         ●
                          ●             ●
                           ●           ●
                             ● ● ● ● ●

Points follow the path shape while maintaining relative positions.
