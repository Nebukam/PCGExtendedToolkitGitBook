# Staging : Fitting

Apply fitting, justification and variations to staged points.

## Overview

This node applies scale-to-fit, justification, and optional transform variations to points that have already been staged. It reads bounds data either from a collection map (written by a prior staging node) or from a static mesh path attribute, then adjusts each point's transform so assets fit correctly within their bounds.

## How It Works

1. **Bounds Resolution**: Reads per-point bounds from either the collection map or by loading static meshes referenced by a path attribute
2. **Scale-to-Fit**: Scales each point's transform so the associated asset fits within the point's bounds according to the configured fit strategy
3. **Justification**: Offsets the asset within the remaining space after scaling, controlling alignment along each axis
4. **Variations** *(Collection Map mode only)*: Applies randomized offset, rotation, or scale adjustments before or after fitting
5. **Output**: Writes the adjusted transforms and optionally records the fitting translation offset as an attribute

#### Usage Notes

- **Post-Staging Node**: This node expects points that have already been staged — it applies fitting as a separate pass rather than during distribution.
- **Collection Map vs Mesh Attribute**: Collection Map mode uses pre-cached bounds from staging data, which is faster. Mesh Attribute mode loads actual static meshes to compute bounds, which is more flexible but heavier.
- **Variations Require Collection Map**: Per-asset variation limits are stored in collection entries, so variations are only available in Collection Map mode.
- **Point Filters**: Supports point filters to control which points receive fitting adjustments.

## Inputs

| Pin | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **In** | Point Data | Staged points to apply fitting to |

## Settings

### Bounds Source

<details>
<summary><strong>Source</strong> <code>EPCGExFittingSource</code></summary>

Where to read asset bounds from.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Collection Map** | Use staged entry data from a collection map to resolve bounds |
| **Mesh Attribute** | Read a static mesh path from an attribute and compute bounds from the mesh bounding box |

Default: `Collection Map`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Asset Path Attribute Name</strong> <code>FName</code></summary>

The name of the attribute containing the static mesh path to load and compute bounds from.

Default: `AssetPath`

</details>

### Fitting

<details>
<summary><strong>Scale To Fit</strong> <code>FPCGExScaleToFitDetails</code></summary>

Controls how assets are scaled to fit within point bounds. Supports uniform and per-axis scaling with configurable fit strategies.

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Justification</strong> <code>FPCGExJustificationDetails</code></summary>

Controls how assets are positioned within point bounds after scaling. Each axis can be independently justified (center, min, max, or custom blend).

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Variations</strong> <code>FPCGExFittingVariationsDetails</code></summary>

Applies randomized transform variations to fitted points. Each transform component can be independently enabled and set to apply before or after fitting calculations.

| Property | Type | Options | Default |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| **Offset** | `EPCGExVariationMode` | Disabled · Before fitting · After fitting | `Disabled` |
| **Rotation** | `EPCGExVariationMode` | Disabled · Before fitting · After fitting | `Disabled` |
| **Scale** | `EPCGExVariationMode` | Disabled · Before fitting · After fitting | `Disabled` |

Default: All `Disabled`

📋 *Visible when Source = Collection Map*

</details>

### Output

<details>
<summary><strong>Prune Empty Points</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Remove points that have no valid staging entry (empty entry). Keeps output clean by discarding points that would spawn nothing.

Default: `true`

⚡ PCG Overridable

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Write Translation</strong> <code>bool</code></summary>

Write the fitting translation offset to an attribute. This is the translation added to the point transform by fitting and justification — useful for offsetting spline meshes.

Default: `false`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Translation Attribute Name</strong> <code>FName</code></summary>

Name of the FVector attribute to write the fitting offset to.

Default: `FittingOffset`

⚡ PCG Overridable

📋 *Visible when Write Translation is enabled*

### Inherited Settings

This node inherits point processing and filtering capabilities from its base class.

→ Point filters can be applied to control which points receive fitting adjustments

## Outputs

| Pin | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **Out** | Point Data | Points with fitting transforms applied |
