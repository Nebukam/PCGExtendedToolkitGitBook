# Example Project

The example project is the best way to see PCGEx in action across all major systems. It's divided into two parts:

* **Showroom** — Abstract showcases of individual nodes and features, one at a time
* **Examples** — More involved setups showing how nodes work together for complex results

## Getting the example project

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Download the project files

<a href="https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExExampleProject/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="button primary">Download the ZIP</a>  or to to the  <a href="https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExExampleProject" class="button secondary">GitHub repo</a>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Install PCGEx

Make sure you have PCGEx installed!\
The project itself has the plugin enabled in the settings, **however it does not have the source embedded.** Head over to [installation.md](../../general/quickstart/installation.md "mention") if you haven't already.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Open the project & dive in!

That's pretty much all there is about it.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The example project includes utility subgraphs that handle boilerplate (consistent formatting, shared setup). These are **not part of the plugin** -- they're project-level helpers.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The example project is only maintained for the latest engine version. Older versions are preserved in git branches but will not reflect the full breadth of available features.
{% endhint %}
