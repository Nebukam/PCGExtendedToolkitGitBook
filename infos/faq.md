# FAQ

## What's the roadmap?

Currently the "roadmap" is **largely driven by user needs and requests**, and I prioritize making sure user can safely migrate their content to the latest updates of the engine.

ðŸ‘† There's a barebone Trello board to provide some visibility.



## I can't package in 5.5.4!

If you get that error, it means you're using the FAB release. Epic messed things up and broke all FAB PCG plugins for that version of the editor: you need to [patch your editor](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/current-available-quick-fix-solutions/2829), or build the plugin from source.

## Do you work with the editor' main branch?

**No.**

Even if I wish I could, I simply don't have the hardware to compile the engine from source and prepare the codebase for upcoming releases, so **I rely solely on preview binaries in the Epic Launcher to start updating the plugin.**
