# v0.65

## New Nodes

### [Uber Branch](../../node-library/quality-of-life/uber-branch.md)

A Branch node that leverages filters to distribute collections to a user-defined number of pins.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that only the filters that work at the collection/data level are supported. Most spatial filters can work with a collection spatial bounds using an new `CheckAgainstDataBounds` checkbox.
{% endhint %}

Each filter group is checked in order until it passes (and is output to the matching pin) or fails entierely (and is output to the Default pin)

### [Branch on Data](../../node-library/quality-of-life/branch-on-data.md)

A dynamic branch node that does simple numeric or text-based comparison against a specific @Data attribute. Suport both user-defined checks & enums (_either test against the enum key or its name_)

### [Verlet Relax](../../node-library/clusters/relax-cluster/verlet.md)

A new relax mode for [Cluster Relax](../../node-library/clusters/relax-cluster/)!

### [Reduce Data](../../node-library/metadata/reduce-data.md)

Same as the native `Attribute Reduce`, but works exclusively on @Data domain attributes.

### [Sample Vtx by ID](../../node-library/sampling/vtx-by-id.md)

A simple yet handy node that can "sample" vtx from a cluster based on their ID. _This is mostly only useful to create contours/paths on cluster in a certain state, modify the cluster and then "reproject" the flat result onto the modified vertices._

### Uber Filter (Splines) <sup><mark style="color:yellow;">Subgraph<mark style="color:yellow;"></sup>

Not a full cpp node but a handy subgraph that behave exactly like [Uber Filter (Collection)](../../node-library/filters/uber-filter-collection.md) but filters out splines instead.

### Wrapping Circle <sup><mark style="color:yellow;">Subgraph<mark style="color:yellow;"></sup>

A simple helper to generate a wide circle of points around a bunch of points.

> Handy when working with organically-shaped Voronoi2D graphs where you want to guarantee all your seeds will generate a closed cell.

### Bounds Cross Section <sup><mark style="color:yellow;">Subgraph<mark style="color:yellow;"></sup>

A simple helper to generate paths that represent the cross section of individual bounds.

## Filters

{% hint style="info" %}
A bunch of spatial filters, such as **Distance**, **Bounds** and **Spline/Path/Polygon inclusion**  now allow to test against the data bounding box, instead of per-point.&#x20;

This takes the form of a new checkbox on the filter named `CheckAgainstDataBounds`. It treats data as a single point which bounds are driven by the point positions & local bounds in space.
{% endhint %}

No new filters.

## Tweaks

### Flood Fill Path Output Optimization

There are some new optimization for the [Cluster' Flood Fill](../../node-library/clusters/flood-fill/) node relative to paths!\
You can now output an "optimized" version of the path to ensure an output that has no overlaps; and either pick to preserve longer paths first, or shorter paths first.

### Offset Path

Back in the days, [Offset](../../node-library/paths/offset.md) had a not-so-good "cleanup" option â€” it's back, and it's better and more reliable! It has a few edge-cases that are hard to cover, and few things to iron out still, but it proudly handles most common cases.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### WaitForPCGData

The [WaitForPCGData](../../node-library/misc/wait-for-pcg-data.md) node now supports per-data (@Data domain) instance.&#x20;

This comes with two new subgraphs as part of the plugin content to spawn & execute PCG graphs easily (_not sure my approach is super efficient, but heh!_)

> Note that these subgraph each **instantiate a new actor** to execute the graph, which by default is destroyed after the generation is complete.

#### Misc Tweaks

* [Spline to Path](../../node-library/paths/spline-to-path.md) now support carrying over spline attributes
* [Voronoi 2D](../../node-library/clusters/diagrams/voronoi-2d.md) now has 3 additional loose data outputs on Sites:
  * Num Influences (_number of delaunay that influenced its position_)
  * Min Radius (_smallest distance to influence single point_)
  * Max Radius (_longest distance to influence single point_)

## Bugfixes

* Sneaky bufix on [Attribute Remap](../../node-library/metadata/attribute-remap.md) that was crashing the editor if you wanted to output the value to a new attribute.
* [Attribute Remap](../../node-library/metadata/attribute-remap.md) now properly output single values when remapping a component to a new attributes. Previously remaping `$Position.X` to `RemappedX` would create an entire new vector and set the `.X`, now it outputs a `RemappedX` double.
* [WriteIndex](../../node-library/metadata/write-index.md) now lets you choose the default output attribute type for `NumEntries` & `CollectionIndex`.
* Some major undetected flaws that made it to 0.64 regarding @Data domain, and a FVector::Min that was using ::Max&#x20;
* Honestly a lot of smaller things.
