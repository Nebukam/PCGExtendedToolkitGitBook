# v0.67 - Cooking

{% hint style="danger" %}
This release is being worked on and reflect the state of github main branch; it is not available on FAB yet.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This release introduces a new plugin dependency : **PCG Geometry Script Interop**.
{% endhint %}

## New Nodes

### [Path : Stitch](../../node-library/paths/stitch.md)

A handy path util that can "connect" path into longer ones based on spatial proximity. It does a lot more than it seems, as some path data needs to be reverted to create a coherent, longer one; also handle closed loops.

{% hint style="info" %}
This one is a bit rough around the edges at the moment
{% endhint %}

### [Normalize](../../node-library/transform/normalize.md)

Nothing fancy, a node that can output the point position normalized against the data bounds in world space — very handy for UV sampling and _other things_.

### [Path Deform](../../node-library/transform/path-deform.md)

TBD



Hoping for:

* Path : Stitch (to stitch disconnected paths together)
* Path : Insert on Segments (to insert points into an existing path)

## Major tweaks

### Subdivision : Manhattan <sup>_<mark style="color:green;">New mode</mark>_</sup>

Any node that had subdivision capabilities ([Subdivide](../../node-library/paths/subdivide.md), [Bevel](../../node-library/paths/bevel.md)) now has an additional more complex mode : Manhattan.

<div><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/manh1.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/bev.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Manhattan bevel, anyone?</p></figcaption></figure></div>

> This is on top of the Distance & Count mode, and will most likely carry over whenever there's an opportunity for subdivision features. _I was initially thinking of making this its own node for easier discovery, but so much of the needed code was already handled where I need general subdivision so..._

### Projection : Best Fit <sup>_<mark style="color:green;">New mode</mark>_</sup>

Any node that offer projection capabilities to do its bidding now has access to a new projection mode : Best Fit, **which computes the best fitting plane and uses its normal as a projection.**&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
This might look underwhelming but it's actually a pretty major improvement when it comes to clusters & contours : **best fit is computed per cluster.** Projection is used by a tons of nodes, but especially contouring ones.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

<div><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Cluster Hull with Normal projection (Default, Up)</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Cluster Hull with Best Fit projection</p></figcaption></figure></div>

> This is available in all contours nodes, hulls, path winding, delaunay etc — anywhere "projection settings" is available. It's not the new default as to not override previous settings, and also this operation is not free on large set of points.

### Cluster Surface

* Cluster Surface now output PCG Dynamic Mesh by default (_Legacy mode is still available for existing setups_)
* Cluster Surface now have proper normals right off the bad (both legacy and PCG)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (64).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="danger" %}
The native DynamicMeshSpawner doesn't handle collision, so if you stop using legacy you will need to enable collision manually (using GoemetryScript & enabling complex collision on the spawned component).
{% endhint %}

### Path + Tangents

Previously, nodes that used paths and expected tangents exposed a simple toggle to apply custom tangents based on attributes; which would, most of the time, force the use of a [Write Tangents](../../node-library/paths/write-tangents/) node right before.

This behavior has changed, and while you can still use attributes, **the modules that used to be only exposed in Write Tangents are now available "in place"**. It's slightly more expensive but doesn't duplicate the data — and scaling is supported there too!

### Connect Cluster - Additional outputs

[Connect Cluster](../../node-library/clusters/connect-clusters.md) now has  two optional outputs :&#x20;

* Vtx Connector Flag : increment an `int32` each time a bridge connects to it.
* Edge Connector Flag : set a `bool` on a edge if it's a newly created bridge.

## Filters

No new filters.

## Tweaks

* Compare Nearest filter now support multiple source targets
* Convex Hull 2D now has the (disabled by default) option to not output mirror cluster. Couldn't enable it for legacy reason but it saves tons of memory when you only need the paths and have lots of them.

## Bugfixes

A bunch of them.
