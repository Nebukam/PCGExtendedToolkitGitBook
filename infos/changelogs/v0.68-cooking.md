# v0.68 - Cooking

{% hint style="danger" %}
This release is being worked on and reflect the state of github main branch; it is not available on FAB yet.
{% endhint %}

> 0.68 has few completely new features, but instead is a more stability & QoL-focused one. I've been trying to reduce compile times & binary size (with little success), address some recurring pain points etc.
