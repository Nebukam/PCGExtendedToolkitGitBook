# v0.68 - Cooking

{% hint style="danger" %}
This release is being worked on and reflect the state of github main branch; it is not available on FAB yet.
{% endhint %}

> 0.68 has few completely new features, but instead is a more stability & QoL-focused one. I've been trying to reduce compile times & binary size (with little success), address some recurring pain points etc.

## Deprecation x Replacements

In order to make the codebase more maintainable, a couple of filters have been deprecated in favor of alternatives that handle all usecase more efficiently.

### [Filter : Inclusion](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/spatial/inclusion.md)

{% hint style="success" %}
Targets accepts any path-like data such as **Paths**, **Splines**, and soon **Polygon2D**.
{% endhint %}

Replaces [Filter : Path Inclusion](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/spatial/path-inclusion.md), [Filter : Spline Inclusion](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/spatial/spline-inclusion.md) and [Filter : Polygon 2D Inclusion](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/spatial/polygon-2d-inclusion.md). It's almost a drop-in replacement : you can copy-paste most settings from the old nodes to the new one by doing the `right-click/left-click trick` on the **Settings** subsection of the detail panels.

### [Filter : Time](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/spatial/time.md)

**Same as above**, but for [Filter : Path Alpha](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/spatial/path-alpha.md) and [Filter : Spline Alpha](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/spatial/spline-alpha.md)
