# v0.70

{% hint style="info" %}
**Yes, 0.69 got skipped**. It was mostly bugfixes, and I ended up pushing a lot of its content under the 0.68.xx tags â€” I'm sure some of you will see that as a _nice_ missed opportunity.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
This update is two fold : on one hand, there's the update for the 5.7 version of the engine, and on the other end there's a backport of all the good things I did for 5.7 into 5.6!&#x20;

This also means that non including critical bugfixes, this is the last release for 5.6, **further development will happen for 5.7 only.**
{% endhint %}

## 5.7 Specifics

As some of you may have seen, 5.7 introduces a new _data type registry_; allowing a much smoother management of custom PCG data types. The most visible impact as a PCG user is **icons**!

Colors are exposed for you to tweak under `Project Settings / PCGEx` . There's sensible defaults for now; and more importantly : plugins settings have changed their base type and registry so those have been reset by the update.&#x20;

> If you had tweaks done in those settings, you can retrieve them in the `DefaultEngine.ini` and move the PCGEx stuff to `DefaultGame.ini` instead.\
> Look for `[/Script/PCGExtendedToolkit.PCGExGlobalSettings]` !

## New Nodes

> Some of those already made it 0.69.x but without much noise

### [Tuple](../../node-library/quality-of-life/tuple.md)

A nifty (_if I say so_) quality of life node that lets you create

### [Path : Slide](../../node-library/paths/slide.md)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (84).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This one with look silly but really is a welcome addition for folks doing a lot spatial filtering/data-matching based on path _segments_. It can slide path points along the path and store the original position (_and  restore it later on_)

> Since path "segments" are primarily identified by the first point of the segment, it's often very annoying or tricky to test against these points as opposed to, say, the middle of the segment. `Path : Slide` works around that problem by letting you literally **move the points somewhere else on the segment so they're located where it make sense for testing**, and you can restore the original aspect with that same node later down the line.

### [Sample : Sockets](../../node-library/sampling/sockets.md)

You now have a one-stop node for all your mesh sockets needs.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (87).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

> It takes a list of points with mesh references on them (_what you'd get from staging or grammar_) and extract all, or filtered sockets and output them as a new set of points.
>
> _You can also selectively choose which of the socket axis inherit the point scale, which is handy for grammar module that gets stretched over a specific axis and you want the socket to retain its original scale._

#### Socket support in Mesh Collections

Part of this update also include socket support directly as part of [mesh-collection.md](../../node-library/assets-management/collections/mesh-collection.md "mention")!

### Merge Path<sup><mark style="color:$warning;">Subgraph<mark style="color:$warning;"></sup>

## Filters

No new filters.

## Tweaks

#### Stable Seeds

[@staminajim](https://github.com/staminajim) did fixed some really old unstable seed-generation code for some shiny, platform-wide stable seed generation for all seed-things PCGEx. This guarantees deterministic seeds on stuff like clusters as there was some minor discrepancies that would cascade into major ones.&#x20;

#### Other tweaks

* Rudimentary material override for Spline Mesh (Simple)!
* [Heuristic Attribute](../../node-library/pathfinding/heuristics/hx-attribute.md) now lets you use raw attribute values instead of forcing automatic normalization on you.&#x20;
* Full refactor of OOB code & Best Fit Plane maths so they prioritize best orientation with the world axis as opposed to producing correct yet weird results. This affect a whole lot of nodes but should be unnoticeable except for [Bounds Axis to Points](../../node-library/misc/bounds-axis-to-points.md) and [Points to Bounds](../../node-library/misc/points-to-bounds.md). &#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Best Fit Plane by default will align the X axis over the longest dimension, Y on the middle one and Z over the  smallest one. **It's worth noting because it can now be reliably used to find the longest, smallest or median axis of any group of points.**
{% endhint %}

* Proper blending on Path x Bounds Intersection node along with **some&#x20;**<mark style="color:$success;">**new extra outputs**</mark>**, and&#x20;**<mark style="color:$primary;">**some removed**</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}
`IsInside` has been removed as an output from this node, use [Filter : Bounds](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/spatial/bounds.md) instead.
{% endhint %}

## Bugfixes

A lot of them. Various crashes and typos that would be revealed by very edgy special cases from people doing very odd things.
