# v0.66 - Cooking

{% hint style="danger" %}
This release is being worked on and reflect the state of github main branch; it is not available on FAB yet.
{% endhint %}

## New Nodes

### [Sort Collections](../../node-library/misc/sort-points-1.md)

A simple yet handy node that let your sort data collections based on @Data domain attributes. It leverages [PCGEx Sorting Rules](../../node-library/misc/sort-points/sorting-rule.md).

### [Picker : Ranges from Set](../../node-library/filters/cherry-pick-points/picker-constant-set-1.md)

A new picker subnode that reads FVector2 as ranges of indices, works with any picker input.

### Cookie Cut <sup>_<mark style="color:yellow;">Subgraph</mark>_</sup>

A new util subgraph, a barebone "Cookie cutter" node. Serves both as an util, and a useful example to get an idea on how to do these stuff

Hoping for:

* Path : Manhattan
* Path : Stitch (to stitch disconnected paths together)
* Path : Insert on Segments (to insert points into an existing path)

## Filters

### [Angle Filter](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/self-comparisons/numeric-1.md)

The angle filter is a simple yet handy filter that does a comparison against the "angle" of a point. You can test against **Curvature** (Prev -> Current x Current -> Next) or **Spread** (Current -> Prev x Current -> Next). It will work with any dataset, it just that it's only meaningful if that data is ordered ^^

## Tweaks

* The [Path Shift](../../node-library/paths/shift.md) node now has an additional shifting type, `Cherry Pick`, that lets you, well, _cherry pick_ exactly what properties and/or attributes you want to shift.
* The [Within Range](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/simple-comparisons/within-range.md) filter now support external attribute set to read multiple ranges to test against.&#x20;
*   [Spline Mesh ](../../node-library/paths/spline-mesh/)& [Spline Mesh (Simple)](../../node-library/paths/spline-mesh/spline-mesh-simple.md) now read the the spline axis alignement from the static mesh descriptor, defaulting to the node' descriptor. There's a clean deprecation path so you shouldn't see any difference, but if you do, you change it from now on :\

    That value can be set per-entry in the [Mesh Collection](../../node-library/assets-management/collections/mesh-collection.md), under the **SM Descriptor** settings!

## Bugfixes

* [Goal Picker random](../../node-library/pathfinding/pathfinding-edges/goal-picker-random.md) was busted, it's fixed now. It would only ever pick a single not-quite-random goal.
