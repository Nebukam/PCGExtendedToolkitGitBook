# v0.66 - Cooking

{% hint style="danger" %}
This release is being worked on and reflect the state of github main branch; it is not available on FAB yet.
{% endhint %}

## New Nodes

### [Sort Collections](../../node-library/misc/sort-points-1.md)

A simple yet handy node that let your sort data collections based on @Data domain attributes. It leverages [PCGEx Sorting Rules](../../node-library/misc/sort-points/sorting-rule.md).

### [Picker : Ranges from Set](../../node-library/filters/cherry-pick-points/picker-constant-set-1.md)

A new picker subnode that reads FVector2 as ranges of indices, works with any picker input.

Hoping for:

* Path : Manhattan
* Path : Stitch (to stitch disconnected paths together)
* Path : Insert on Segments (to insert points into an existing path)

## Filters

### [Angle Filter](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/self-comparisons/numeric-1.md)

The angle filter is a simple yet handy filter that does a comparison against the "angle" of a point. You can test against **Curvature** (Prev -> Current x Current -> Next) or **Spread** (Current -> Prev x Current -> Next). It will work with any dataset, it just that it's only meaningful if that data is ordered ^^

## Tweaks

* The [Path Shift](../../node-library/paths/shift.md) node now has an additional shifting type, `Cherry Pick`, that lets you, well, _cherry pick_ exactly what properties and/or attributes you want to shift.
* The [Within Range](../../node-library/filters/filters-points/simple-comparisons/within-range.md) filter now support external attribute set to read multiple ranges to test against.&#x20;

## Bugfixes

* [Goal Picker random](../../node-library/pathfinding/pathfinding-edges/goal-picker-random.md) was busted, it's fixed now. It would only ever pick a single not-quite-random goal.
