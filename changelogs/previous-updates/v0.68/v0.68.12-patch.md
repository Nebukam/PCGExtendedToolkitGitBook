# v0.68.12 Patch

## Expanded Asset Collection Features

This patch implement a discreet yet major tweak to the asset collection : <mark style="color:$success;">**socket support**</mark>! Sockets are automatically fetched from the static mesh asset, and you can manually add custom ones under staging/sockets.

#### Asset Staging + Socket

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (161).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On the [Asset Staging](/broken/pages/cLPLrkgysgkezVpY7EH9) node, Socket output settings can be found under **Additional Outputs / Output Sockets.**

#### Socket Staging

Additionally, there's a new node, specifically designed to work with the Asset Staging node when using the collection map mode. Since that output mode allow to combine many staging at once, it's handy to **output only the final, filtered out sockets off of a staging chain.**

#### Absolute Rotation

Under **Variations**, it is now possible to select & apply absolute rotation _per axis_ (Yaw/Pitch/Roll)

{% hint style="success" %}
In order to benefit from this update, you will need to rebuild staging collection. It's a one-click move for the entire project at the top of any asset collection.
{% endhint %}

## Spline Mesh Updates

Both spline mesh nodes ([Simple](/broken/pages/E2CtOe0Knu5d6wVQeJuD) & [Collection](/broken/pages/ZS9nQlgX6BfSz6GkhjLz)) now expose the familiar Property Override Definitions; letting you override the spawned `USplineMeshComponent`' properties using attributes values.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is especially handy to override the forward axis on the Simple node. _Note that using invalid values will crash the engine, and there's nothing I can do about that so be careful._
{% endhint %}

## New Nodes

### Outline 2D <sup><mark style="color:$warning;">Subgraph<mark style="color:$warning;"></sup>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (164).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Similar to Concave Hull, this one uses a more expensive method in order to find relation to depth (inside/outside), including "inner" outlines that are not the outer hull.



### [Sample : Sockets](/broken/pages/WoD3xFQ0DFnOImxxBh91)

Does what it says. Output the sockets of static mesh reference by reading them on an attribute. Handy if you use grammar and can't leverage collection, or don't want to suffer blueprint performance.

**This node basically packs find socket + copy to points, without any loops nor extra data copies in memory**.

## Tweaks & Bugfixes

* Added max connection threshold to the [Numeric Compare](/broken/pages/5SYY2VmZeVgy36SmSnWR) probe
* Fixed an issue where some point properties would not be properly inherited, resulting in zeroed-out bounds out of some specific nodes.
* Added a bunch of default instanced values in a bunch of places — for instance, Pathfinding nodes now have a search algorithm selected by default. Did the same anywhere it was relevant.
* Added optional self exclusion on [Inclusion](/broken/pages/Vodj8qZZWkQe7ud1YXLn) filter, allowing to easily batch-test inclusions
