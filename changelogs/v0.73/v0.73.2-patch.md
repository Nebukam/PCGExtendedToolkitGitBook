# v0.73.2 Patch

## Build

* `SubModules.generated.h` **has been moved to the plugin' Intermediate folder** (was previously in a module folder) so no more svn hurdles. _Sorry I should've done that from the beginning ^^_

> it's possible that you need to manually go and delete the old `PCGExtendedToolkit\Source\PCGExtendedToolkit\Private\Generated` folder.

* PCGExtendedToolkit content folder now includes a **Label** data asset which should force-cook all PCGEx dependencies without the need to manually add the plugin folder to your cooked dependencies.

## PCG Data Asset Collection

You can now create asset collections that contains PCG Data Assets! You can stage them like any other assets using the [asset-staging](../../node-library/assets-management/asset-staging/ "mention")node, but you have to "spawn" them using the new [pcgdataasset-loader.md](../../node-library/assets-management/pcgdataasset-loader.md "mention").

> You'll need to setup pins yourself of course because at graph editing time it's impossible to know about it. If a data has no valid pin to be output one (name + type), it will go to the out pin instead and will have a `Pin:Name_of_original_pin` tag.

## New Nodes

### [PCGDataAssetLoader](../../node-library/assets-management/pcgdataasset-loader.md)

See above.

### [Staged Type Filter](../../node-library/assets-management/staged-type-filter.md)

A simple filter node to filter out points that don't belong to a given collection type. This became needed as it is now possible to do staging from mixed source (by reading the source collection directly from a point attribute); so you can redirect actors, data assets etc to the right places.

> Note that it's using the Collection Registry, so it will integrate seamlessly with your custom collection, if you have any!

### [Clipper2 : Triangulate](../../node-library/topology/clipper2-triangulate.md)

I added some more Clipper2 features, including **polytree triangulation** (_constrained Delaunay or raw_), meaning you can feed it a bunch of paths, as long as they don't intersect <mark style="color:$success;">**the node will automagically detect what is a hole and what isn't**</mark>, and generate geometry in between.

### [Clipper2 : Clip Rect](../../node-library/paths/clipper2/clipper2-clip-rect.md)

Clip Rect made it as well. The bound is a lie, it's actually operating on an axis-aligned rectangle inferred from operands bounds.

> While it's limited to AABB it still prove useful to work with paths only within partitions; without the need for previously circumvoluted setups involving finding crossings, filtering, etc.

## Tweaks & bugfixes

{% hint style="danger" %}
This patch comes with a default value update on the [asset-staging](../../working-with-pcgex/asset-staging/ "mention")node : default output type is now `Collection Map` instead of the previous `Asset Path` as it is the primary intended use.
{% endhint %}

* Fixed [uber-noise.md](../../node-library/metadata/uber-noise.md "mention") mutate mode
* Re-introduced per-node execution policy, allowing to force the execution of a node without wait/pause in the PCG task graph. _Use cautiously as it's enabled at a low level but not fully supported by all nodes._
* [bevel.md](../../node-library/paths/bevel.md "mention")now supports beveling that won't be limited by neighboring points!
* [data-matching](../../node-library/misc/data-matching/ "mention")rules now have an **Invert** toggle.
* Geometry generators now expose a **Flip Normal** toggle in the topology settings.
