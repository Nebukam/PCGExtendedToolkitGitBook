# v0.73.1 Patch

## New Nodes

#### Clipper2 Integration

I've been hard at work on embedding and interfacing with Clipper2 for all path-related operations. There's an obvious overlap with 5.7' Polygons 2D; but [offset.md](../../node-library/paths/offset.md "mention")has been really bad at dealing with self intersections so I wanted something that could work straight from points without the need for converting things to two-dimensional data; and with better preservation of data.&#x20;

Shoutout to James V who has been of great help with this; as he has tons of experience with Clipper2 .o/

## New Shapes

### [Shape : 3D Grid](../../node-library/misc/shapes/shape-3d-grid.md)

Long overdue, [shape-3d-grid.md](../../node-library/misc/shapes/shape-3d-grid.md "mention") is the PCGEx' shape equivalent of the PCG' `Create Point Grid`.

## New Probes

I've added a new type of probes that are "global" : instead of being processed per-point like before, some probes can now process input points in one go; allowing some more interesting stuff for the future. Those are still probes so they combine naturally with any other probes but **can generate entire diagrams on their own**.

### [Probe : KNN](../../node-library/clusters/connect-points/probe-knn.md)

## Noise System

Something I feel has been missing from PCG is a proper 3D procedural noise ecosystem : no more!

This is CPU only; obviously it would've been more efficient on GPU but I really like the flexibility I get from those smaller ecosystems of node and features. At the time of writing I've only added noise to tensors, but will make a UberNoise node to the mix, as well as a threshold filter that uses noise subnodes.

Check out the list of [noises](../../node-library/misc/noises/ "mention"), there's a bunch (_probably more than necessary_)

## Tweaks

* New Search algorithms for pathfinding
  * Bidirectional _(faster with very large graphs)_
  * Bellman-Ford _(slower but better handling of negative weights when using raw_ [hx-attribute.md](../../node-library/pathfinding/heuristics/hx-attribute.md "mention")_)_
* New distance mode for samplers & nodes that expose distance settings
  * Euclidian _(default)_
  * Manhattan
  * Chebyshev
